It helps to hear words of support that I'm going to make it through this tough time.  I've never meditate before.  Do you listen to music or just silence.  I would love to give that a shot.  I try to take deep breaths.  Oftentimes it helps but only for a moment.  Maybe mediation could help me overall for longer periods of time.<|endoftext|>You're not failing as long as you're still trying and not giving up.  All we can do sometimes is pick ourselves back up and keep plugging along.  There are a few apps available that have calming music, stories to listen to,  or even breath exercises to try.  They are all over the app stores.  It definitely helps me!  Meditation has been proven to help a lot of people in stressful situations.<|endoftext|>That's so true!  I'm going to write that down and post it on my fridge!  Those are the words I'm going to live by for the next while.  I'll look up some apps!  Thank you for being such a great listener and supporter.  I feel so much lighter and hopeful.  I can't believe how much this has helped me.  I look forward to chatting again soon.  Thank you so much!  You have no idea how grateful I am to you right now.  I won't give up!<|endoftext|>Of course, so happy to be of help!  Hopefully we can talk again soon and catch up on how you've been doing.  It helps me a lot to know I'm helping others too, any kind of service always feels nice.<|endoftext|>Thanks again!

Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. black and white thinking...let me think for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white<|endoftext|>Yeah, I think I understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk.<|endoftext|>Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me. yeah exactly. Because people are being selfish and are subjecting others to risks even if they don't care about themselves. but I know I am pretty extreme in my thinking. I really love the outdoors and I go out pretty often before the pandemic. But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it. But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell.<|endoftext|>I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent. We're wired to try and make sense of the world, and maybe our brains don't like to spend time on nuance and grey areas. We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white.<|endoftext|>yeah I understand your thinking with the grey areas as well.

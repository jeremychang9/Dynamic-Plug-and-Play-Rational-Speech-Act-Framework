I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming.<|endoftext|>I also was helped a lot by a Christian Preacher, he's long dead, but he has audio on youtube -- Frank Hammond, Pigs in the Parlor. It's a 5 part series I found helpful, you might want to jot that down.  And I do encourage you to find a counselor, once you rule out the physical (doctor) then you can look at emotional, mental and/or spiritual. I think most of everything is spiritual and emotional to some degree, and our body just responds to that.<|endoftext|>I always lose sight of how to make things better.

But please have hope, sometimes we go through these things to possible get to deeper issues that might need to be dealt with. We only have a few minutes here, but I'm pretty old and I have found this to be true so many times.  Get a good support system of good friends. Having people who \"get\" you is SO vital to our lives.

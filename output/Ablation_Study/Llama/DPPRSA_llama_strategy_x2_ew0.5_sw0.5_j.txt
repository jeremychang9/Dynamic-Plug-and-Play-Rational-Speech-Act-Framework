What is going on? What problems do you have now? I'm listening. Can you give me some more context? Even though it might sound a bit silly, I want to be sure I understand what is going on. Please tell me about the problems you are having now.
So you feel that you have a problem with motivation and that it is causing you problems in your life? Is that correct? This has been an issue with many people throughout history.
It seems like there is some tension at the university. Are you feeling isolated in a situation? Have you spoken to the professor? And are you allowed to look for a new school? I think that you would find a new school if you go through that process.
Well that means I need to say that I can understand that. Not all schools have such offerings. Is there someone you could speak to about that? I can look into that if you'd like. Do you have any family or friends around you?
Also from what I have experienced and heard from others, school counselors usually know how to help you. They may be able to connect you with a potential tutor. And if the prof is not willing to work with you, perhaps speak to your academic advisor.
I would go to your school secretary or the school office and ask if they can help you or direct you to someone who can. Do you have family that you can talk to or people you can call? Maybe they could help you feel more at ease. Do you have friends that you can call?
Yes, we should pursue higher education. Many other people are doing that. Some have already succeeded. As a science student, you could get a job in that field. Maybe a lab researcher or scientist. You can make more money there. Remember, time is short.
Do you think this university is a good fit for you? I had the same thing happen to me, but then I spoke to a school counselor, and then I was able to get a scholarship! I followed up with the administration. They saw how hard I worked, and they adjusted their plan.
Transferring would give you a better chance of getting a good job too. We want you to get a good job, not waste your time! You can use the jobs you can get after school to support yourself. Where you like?
You are welcome! I am glad that I could be of some use to you. Keep your eyes open! :) :) You are being very patient and smart for reaching out for help! Keep being so positive! :) I am rooting for you! You are going to do it!
Bye! Don't give up! I can definitely help you as well! From an outsider, I am glad we had the opportunity to talk! Thanks! :) Have a good night! and God bless!
So you think your coworker is spreading rumors about you? Is this true? I feel terrible when someone is spreading rumors. If you don't mind me asking what kind of work do you do? I know it can be hard for someone in a certain type of work.
So this co worker has been working behind your back at work? That's some hard work to deal with at work. Have you reported this to management? Maybe you can get them to address this problem. You can't keep dealing with this all the time.
I see. Sounds like you've tried talking to her about how you're feeling. Do you think this co-worker has any idea how your stress might be affecting you? Maybe she could understand your perspective on things. Could she have any issues with her own job or management?
How do you feel about this situation? Do you feel confident in your ability to handle your job? How do you feel about working for someone who is afraid to ask for a specific piece of work? Do you think this is a really serious problem?
It sounds like the co-worker is trying to accomplish something they want to do. Is it something that the company feels you should do? Would you like to talk to your co-worker about this? It would help if your co-worker could have the feedback and understand your constraints.
Ok, sounds like HR can be helpful. Do you think HR can look into your co-worker's behavior and say it's not okay for her to gossip? Has anyone else complained? Could it be a company-wide issue? Could it be a co-worker issue?
I feel you on this one too. This is a really stressful situation and the company is under pressure to make an image improvement. It sounds like your co-worker is being very insecure. Has your co-worker been like this before? In any other workplace? Is there a pattern?
Are they good friends? Are there others that you could turn to? Are there any solutions to a management issue that might be surrounding you? Perhaps a mediation? That is one option that you could use. I would ask about availability. Some benefits employers offer these sorts of programs.
I would advise to not make a comment that directly accuses your co-worker of insubordination or trying to overstep your authority. Instead try to present it in a constructive manner where you highlight your feelings and suggest a solution. Perhaps you could see a meeting with your co-worker to express your concerns.
They may help you find a solution to this problem. Would that be something you are willing to do? Are you at least willing to try to find a solution? Do you feel that way? Do you think this is something you are willing to solve on your own?
I am good. How are you? What can I help you with? What you are upset about? You can say all that you feel so that your worries do not fade away? I am here to help you. They can be overwhelming at times? Please tell me about it?
So you're upset because your friend made a lie about you? Is that right? Can you give me some more details about this? I want to understand your situation. How long have you known your friend? Does he have a good reputation in your community?
So you were marketing your business product to potential clients and your friend screwed you out of the opportunity? I am sorry that happened. It sounds like he was dishonest. Is this true? Were you just marketing and promoting your business? It sounds like he took you for a ride.
It sounds like he defrauded you not once but twice. Do you want to be able to recall the kind of friends you have in the future? Is that important to you? Are there other friends that could help you see a therapist?
Just to clarify, the deal he cut with other firms means you could work with them, but you didn't get the amount he did? Was that so? I get you, it sounds like you might be very unlucky. But you are not stupid. Many good people work hard.
We can discuss the safeguards that can be put in place for the future as well as and as well as you wish. Here's a little play I have prepared. Are you open to it? I don't want you to have to go through this more than once!
Well, what would you say you could do differently? Did you ever think of a different path for the relationship? There are plenty of other people out there. It's just your own relationships. Maybe try talking to some of your friends about it and think about what you can do next.
That might have prevented the one-sided decision you don't want. Have you considered a mediator, like the lawyers or a party counselor? Do you have friends that might be able to help with the financial fallout? That might help you recover from the stress of the situation.
If not, perhaps I can give you some additional advice. We can talk more in the chat and after you are done. My hour has to end! :) but it would be great to talk! I hope you have a good evening!
hello, how are you? What's on your mind? What I can help you with? In any case, what's going on with you? I want to know all of the names. Who are you? What will help? Would you like to discuss your struggles with me?
How are you doing today? Is there anything you would like to talk about? I am here to listen. :)? Well everything seems good. How may I assist you? :D???? Do you want to talk about your feelings and how you feel?
Oh no! I am sorry. Have you considered finding another job? I know it can be hard to find a new job. Some people struggle with this especially in these times.
Oh it sounds like you've worked hard for a very long time for your job to happen to you like this. Why don't you think about it as a opportunity for growth? You might be just missing out on getting a better job with a better pay.
Was there a opportunity of advancement somewhere? Or did the current manager have a way of obtaining promotions that might be related to the situation? That might be worth exploring to find a way forward.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think that he may have been unprepared for the job you did? Do you think that he may have stepped on someone or made a mistake? Something is probably going on. Have you talked to him?
Wow that's certainly a shock and not in the best of circumstances either. It must be really difficult to deal with. Have you thought about firing him? It sounds like he has made you feel really unhappy and resentful about your work over the past couple of years.
It's great you have many friends, if so that is great! Everyone knows someone you can count on and no amount of experience is ever too late to start helping you build a new career. Do you know any networks or resources that could help you find better job opportunities? Through LinkedIn etc.?
I am sorry to hear that. You do have the right to keep your job and I would say you should let them know how you feel. Does that make sense? Are you under any undue stress? If you can tell me about it I could give you some support as well.
Yes, it's really not good to let these issues bother you. It seems to me you're more mature then most people who are worried about such things. Maybe you can lean on some of your co-workers who are like that. They are also at a greater risk of the same thing.
Do you have a support network outside of work? Friends and family? It sounds like you may have a great support system. You are correct that you will have a better job and it sounds like the future is looking very bright.
Great way to have change and understanding! I hope it all goes well for you! Good luck! :) Can I help you in any other way? I am here! :) :) :).. can you leave the chat? I hope I am the last person on your list! : ) :) :)!
I think this is a great idea. All that thinking about how to see change in your life, with all the business, will impress your manager. Don't think it will at first, but your questions are productive, if you think it.
No I did not realize that. Are they suitable for indoor living? That is a different question altogether. Just me stating my thinking. I have been asking myself the same question as myself and sometimes find it helpful to list all of the potential new things we could consider.
I think you have a great vision. You deserve to be happy. Maybe think about a mentor and a great career path you could consider. Have a few minute conversation with them. Ask them for advice. Let me know what's best for you. Thank you for sharing your great mental state.
That is great! I wish you all the best. The end....If there is more to talk about you could definitely talk later today. :) "exuberance towards a couple of smaller goals one at a time." :) Balance between multiple aspirations.
You are welcome. Thank you for your time and enjoy those fish! Let's talk about other angles when you feel more relaxed. You can reach out to me anytime. Goodbye. Have a great evening and time of your life. Enjoy! You can too! You got this!
You are welcome. Can you start talking now? and quit after! The statement. I think it is done. I can't wait!. Good Bye.!!. :) :) :) :) :) :) :)!
I can understand how that feels. Have you been having sleep problems for a while now? Or is it just that it has recently become a problem for you? What time of day are you having trouble falling asleep? Do you have a particular plan in place to help you fall asleep?
Keep active and exercise regularly. You can also drink green tea which is known to be beneficial for sleep. Would you like to give it a try? Also, avoid chocolates as they are not good for you. If you get tired do not go out of your home.
I exercised this way for about 2 weeks. I first woke up from sleep and moved my toes. Then I moved my legs, and after that I moved my arms. Then I moved my face. It didn't help much.
I think it is better and also very very easy to do. The research of the body shows that there are different kind of muscle tension that we can contract in our body, for example we have a muscle called trapezius that makes chest room.
Anyway, I feel that you have got some time to search and find some kind of solution to sleep problems. Take all your time and let it be your priority. It will help you and you will be able to get your required rest. I wish you all the best. Take care.
I mean yeah, but definitely do these things before going to sleep and make a positive mindset towards your life. I think any other really helps and works best. When I was tired I slept only 5 hours at night and I used to sleep fast but i do not sleep well.
You can either feeling refreshed and active after try those or feeling tired but trying to fall asleep. Sometimes I do the breathing exercise but my sleep pattern starts working fine. Both can be done and tried with good intentions. Different people might respond better or differently to those. But it is a start.
It was about 2 months of trying different exercises which is another hour of exercise each day. However, one day they seem to work well. It really depends on you to do it. Remember do not put any pressure to yourself. They will work only if you give them time.
If it doesn't improve right away, please don't worry I can still help! You can try more activities which you find more effective for you. :) You have to give it a try :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
After seeing the improvement in my sleep, I felt relaxed and more hydrated too. Our body needs sleep. Our body is healing from the stress and injury from the road we are driving. We need sleep to heal our body. So basically, everything that affects our body affected sleep.
Yeah with sleep you will feel happy, less stress, more energy. When you sleep you have so much energy to perform daily activities. Happy to help! Take care. Bye! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
great to hear! Do you need to talk about anything in particular? I'm happy to listen! ;) I'm good. I'm good. :) How can I help? :) Can we start with something?
That's a challenging process and I can understand why you'd be feeling self doubt and anxiety. I'm in the same position personally. Do you want to share more about it? I'll try my best to offer some advice or suggestions.
What field were you in? Or were you self employed? That makes the situation even more challenging. Things are a bit different now. Do you have any other income? Unemployment pay is pretty low. Do you have any other skills that would be useful to hire for?
Yes that's perfectly all right. I know a lot of people who have found valuable work outside of their field that had nothing to do with their original work. Do you have a list of things you'd like to try? Maybe some freelancing? Or perhaps volunteering?
You are correct. But if you work at a stable job, it could eventually pay off in the long run. Also, there are some strategies that could help you find a suitable job. Consider asking friends of your friends if they can put you on to someone.
What are your hobbies? Maybe you have something that you could make money out of? It might help with your stress and depression too. People seem to be surprised by the potential money that can be made out of hobbies. Is that correct?
Have you thought of taking an online course or maybe a book series? Are there any particular skills you've been meaning to improve?
Okay so it sounds like computer skills might be an area you can use your spare time to learn further or maybe help someone else build their career. Sounds like a good way to use your time. Have you considered enrolling in a course of some sort?
I have a sister who teaches a few courses online she said they're very challenging but she likes them. Perhaps you could look into that? Maybe she can help you out? ;) But its a great place to be in! I mean research is a necessary part of career development after all.
Can I just add that it can be hard as well as more relaxing, I think? It might be worth it though. :) I am not sure I have the skills to help you though haha because I am not actually able to work from home due to the pandemic.
There are something called the government's Job Gateway which offers help in that area I believe. I'm not sure how you might use it but that would certainly give you some reassurance. Do you have anyone in your family with you? If so, perhaps you could ask them about it?
What about looking for a paid job through a career website? Many are not willing to pay after they have you on board for a certain amount of time. You'd need to pay them after they've taken the money from you for a while. Is that something you would be interested in?
Hi, how are you today? What would you like to talk about? I can give you some advice too if you need it. It is my pleasure to support you. Do not be shy and express your feelings. If you are feeling any grief or any issue, please talk to me.
I am sorry to hear that. What is happening? Maybe I can help you? Would you like to tell me more about it? Are you feeling depressed, or perhaps anxious? I am listening. Could you please tell me about your problem? How long has it been happening?
Why would she not have any excuses and you only have to chat with her? Why do you find it hard to hang out? Can you share any more details?? I believe that is the only solution to that! Use her excuse on her.
That would be hard. What do you think might be the reason she has started showing you these houses? Do you think she might be shy? Or has she been stressed and busy? Are there any other factors? Maybe something about the pandemic which makes her act shy?
One way to show you care is to make her feel special, even though she's being rude to you. I know you've expressed that to her before. Maybe you could give her a call and talk to her, and let her know how you've been feeling.
Have you tried reaching out to her again in a few days and letting her know how you feel? Sometimes just having someone know that you're thinking of them can help. I've done that and it usually works out pretty well. She's never seemed to mind.
It sounds like she really doesn't care about you. I would try to avoid her, if I were you. You are right, you deserve someone who cares about you, who prioritizes you. If it was my choice, I would also try to stay away from her.
Yes you could take a break. It's not that I am saying you can't ever find a new friend again, because everyone is busy at that point in time. However, you never know until it comes to a point that you are busy. You can't be in two places at once.
I would suggest the first option. But also just try to stay connected and know that you are still friends, even if you can't see each other. It seems like they need some time and space, not actually be able to get rid of you.
my pleasure. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, just hit the quit button. have a good day!
hi, how are you? Greetings, my name is Reginald. I am a carpool helper. How may I assist you today? Please do feel free to share what you have to say. I will do my best. Thank you for your time.
Ok, what other classes are you considering? Could you come out into the light? Do you think you can find something? You will be fine. All you need to do is have faith. Just take it one day at a time and you will be fine.
How about things like marketing, something you would need in your job? That's probably a class you can get through. Is that something you've thought about?
Well, you want to avoid taking psychology classes? I understand, this is hard with the pandemic but I do hope things start to look up soon for you. I'd say just keep up with your college classes and maybe start looking around online for a job.
What kind of classes did you want to take? Is there a particular major that you want to pursue? Is there a school you want to attend? Or is it just a spontaneous decision? Can I ask about your personal interests? They can help a lot.
I would try to see what is working for you in the courses you're in and what you can ask your advisors or professors about a path forward in your education. They will definitely help you out. And I am sure that with some diligent work and progress, you will get there!
Do you have plans? What are your goals for the next year? What do you like to do? What do you think you could use help with? You might get a mentor, or at least a resource to help you! On your side with it, I feel like this will help!
No problem. Good luck! You sound like you are on the right path! Have fun with your final exams and it goes without saying, good luck! Have a nice day! :) think tank, like a ventra friend.
You know that is a good start. I hope that helps you make a decision. Best of luck with it. Let me know if I can be of more assistance. Have a good day! :) Can you leave?
Your welcome. Have a great day. Get out there and show those dreams!. Come back if you need help. :).
Take care! :)! : ) :)! :)! :) : ) :) : : ) : :) : :) : : :! :) : :) : :) : : : :!
No! What do you mean by covid 20? Is it the Covid vaccine that comes out in the coming days? Or is it something else? Do tell. I am not aware of anything since my last update. Is there any issue at home or in your job? Just asking.
Wow, so you are positive that you are not going to catch it. That is good! It would be bad if you did get it. I hope that the test was one of the five at the local health center. Those are always good.
I believe it does help to control it. Are you hoping to get it? Are you worried about it? How are you feeling about it? Really sorry I'm not doing a great job with this - but we can't think about anything but COVID for a while.
Are you in London? I know some of my friends got vaccinated in that city. Have you? I am not in London, but I live near it. It can get really scary. Is it safe? Have you been feeling scarily sick? Or do you have symptoms of the new virus?
I can understand that. I understand how you're feeling about everything. Everything was going great until it started. Is this correct? Or are you concerned about other things as well? I know this has been difficult for everyone. I think it's nice you are being supportive.
As for side effects, some people report that they have a high fever. I have to say, this has only happened to me a few times. I also run a small side hustle to ease my anxiety. Even when a vaccine is approved, I usually pick and choose.
I am surprised you are remote. I usually see many others working from home. I try to keep myself occupied by watching shows or movies online and doing it occasionally. Is that something that might be a good idea to do in the future? Maybe streaming the new movies. I do love new movies!
That's very good of you. What do you do remotely? Is there a career you are in need of a vaccine? Perhaps you could start looking into that? If not, what are your hobbies? It sounds like you have a wonderful time relaxing. What can you do in your free time?
Not a problem. Hope that at least helps. I hope you are able to stay safe and healthy. Is there anything else I can help you with? Thank you! Enjoy your day! :), or kidding on the extreme end.! :)! :) it is a pandemic after all :).
I was able to connect from my home here. Any other type of mental health topics I can help with? :)...any issues you have with eating or anxiety? Things like that that I may not have covered? :) :) :) I can talk more if you want.
Hi. How are you today? Maybe you could tell me a little about yourself? I am here to listen. My chat window is on the left. :) Missing you. I hope you are doing well. I am doing pretty well myself. Did you have anything you'd like to talk about?
I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what is bothering you? Is there something specific that is making you feel disturbed? Perhaps there is a specific reason why you feel that way?
It's especially hard during a pandemic because everyone is so uncertain about the future. I've been there too. What is it about your university program that feels like a dead end? Have you talked to anyone about this? Maybe you could discuss it with someone in your department?
So, if you think that you are wasting your time in university, that's understandable. Do you want to talk about what's making you feel this way? Some students go through the same thing, even if they're both happy to be in college.
No, but I can relate to feeling uncertain about our goals. I had a really hard time finding a job when I finished college. I thought a lot about what I wanted to do with my life. I ended up going into management and then eventually management in an academic setting.
What do you think would make your experience less stressful? Has there been anything specific that's been hindering your efforts? Please keep in mind that this is your first day so you can't get too discouraged! Maybe there are some pitfalls you can steer clear of.
I understand. I have had a lot of nerves going through the same experience. Are there any other friends who also study the same field? Maybe it would be helpful to talk to them. Have you discussed your concerns with your professors yet?
From what I understand, you are worried that you will be the only person in your degree class that doesn't stand out? You're very nervous about this, as I understand it. What do you feel your strengths are in the field of civil engineering?
It is a common feeling among many people. Have you considered talking to people around you or a counselor about your fears? Maybe there would be a solution to them. Sometimes talking is the best way to overcome those problems.
What do you think is the main problem? That is a great problem. Do you think you should terminate? By extension this means lose your job! Perhaps another job to get through this. Or let the company know they are not run by you anymore and find new employer.
Do you have children? I am a mom of 5. I know how family responsibilities can impact things. Can I help in any way? :) I will even give a virtual hug if you need it! :D Amen. :) Marianne.
I've experienced that, but my wife has a dog. She couldn't care for him and I found myself daydreaming that she had taken him. I realized that I wanted to help her more, so we can both be happy.
I think I did a really important project but because of time I got out of my depth. That caused me to further not do anything to correct the issues. After that, I became angry with myself, I did my best. I had to stop doing it.
I am not married either. Being a single mom with three kids is challenging enough without no job and no benefits. Sometimes I feel like I'm alone in my problems, like it is just me and my mind and I don't know who to turn to.
I did the right thing for my career and finances. I left the miserable job that I was in, but I also did the right thing for my kids. I think my kids are better off because of it.
I will say, yes, you do feel guilty, which is normal. That's a sign of healthy living. Remember, your guilt should only be focused on yourself and your family. Don't let it be about you. Try to let it focus on your choices. You made the right choice.
If you can find another position, some entrepreneur built their business with friends by eating away at those friends who had much higher incomes than you. But with hard work, discipline and a hard lower, you can get by.
Good for you. My prayers are for you, to be able to do so. Very lucky indeed. Don't stay in the dark. These are not the only options, this is your last chance. These chances are not perfect.
Do you have any personal drives to pursue your personal interests? Your spouse and kids will support you. Well, your self is already supporting yourself. Take some time for yourself. Tell yourself, "I can do this." Just getting up out of bed in the morning can be difficult.
I don't think the state of being a mom is something he could possibly understand as much as it is a personal decision to have kids. So that would be a positive decision in and of itself.
I am assuming you mean that that he is family. You seem to have a sense of security, and it is okay to ask for what you deserve. I am so sorry that you are feeling this way. I would be terribly disappointed in you if I were you.
hello, how is your day? Would you like to tell me anything? I am happy to help. :) :) I just need to know you are not having trouble. I am here to help. How am I doing? Is there a problem you would like to discuss?
Yes, I can relate. I also suffer from extreme fatigue, especially at the end of the day. My anxiety levels are also a significant factor. I believe in an effort to help, even though it's hard.
So you see yourself as being an entrepreneur who is still developing your business? Are there a lot of bills that need to be paid? It's hard to believe that you've been awake for 24 hours, you feel burnt out.
Have you had anyone to talk to about your exhaustion? Friends or family members? Maybe if you talk it out, they could suggest you do some stuff to try to regain your energy?
What do you do for fun? Do you have hobbies that you enjoy? Maybe doing anything outside can help your mood and energy level. Are you into watching movies, going to the gym, reading or something?
Okay, well I hope that thinking about some stuff made you a little more motivated to get outside. Hopefully that will help. Make sure to wash those hands. I am unable to do that right now. These masks are all pumice rolls. Wishing you all good luck on your deadline.
Have you been encouraging him? It might be helpful to talk to him. I think that doing so might help to address the current situation he is in. I also think that sometimes breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps can be helpful.
I am so sorry to hear that, having someone close to you die due to this is hard to take. I think the illness is much more cumulative than most people realize. I hope that you are getting some better rest.
What are your major fears that have held you back? I'm sure that you have a lot to be proud of. You have these abilities to find ways to help others. Let's focus on finding your strength. Do you remember any of your goals for improvement?
Can you try to leave the window open and then close it back again. So the sunshine will continue for another hour. Maybe even go out and get some fresh air? It might help.
Thanks! I'm glad I could be able to help! I hope you start to feel a bit better soon! :) Have a great day! :]!! : :) :)! :! : :)! :!
Of course! I'm glad you reached out. All is well! :) Love talking with you! Take care! Goodnight. :)!
Hi! How are you doing? Where you feel to talk about today? Would you like to talk about something in particular? I can give you some suggestions for things to talk about. If you don't have anything specific in mind, then please tell me.
Just type it, I am here to help you. :) I see you can see it. Let me know how to proceed. What is the topic? Am I right? :) :) two kids and you are struggling. ok? Please share the problem. :D I am here.
Have you talked with her after that? Was she listening? Do you think that's what she was worried about? Maybe you can try talking with her and telling her about how she is treating you and how that is making you feel.
I realize how you feel, but you are being too hard on yourself, because you did the right thing! I hate it when people get upset with me for doing the right thing. Do you feel comfortable talking to her? I suggest you don't right now!
How about telling her about how horrible she is? Have you been able to do that in the past? I mean giving your opinion on her. I would suggest keeping that as a door opener and catching her off guard that you have been speaking your mind for your own well being. How about that?
I think I understand how you feel. Have you tried communicating with her? Maybe find some time to talk in person when you're both relaxed. Do you think she would listen to your side of the story and let you talk about it in person?
I'm not sure that would be a good idea, as she will get defensive and that's going to make her more upset with you in the end. You need to find another solution that she will agree to and you can get back together that way.
Your emotions do not dictate your friendship, it's how the other person takes it or handles it that matters. You are a good friend to have, so she should take that into account.
If it's none of your business, then there is no need to tell her why you want her to leave but being personal isn't going to help anyone else either, if she wants to get back together she should be the one telling her why she has to leave, you on the other side.
I believe you are worth more than your feelings make you value your life.. choose better than you can't as you don't have much to give now in life. Respect yourself as much as you would want others to respect you.
Otherwise you are not going to be happy in the future, so keep it simple. You should meet new friends, and that will take your mind off of it. Let it be done in two days and go celebrate with them.
I think I have given you some good suggestions :) but I think if you hang out with your friends in reality, maybe they will see that you are not the type of person who is selfish just because you felt frustrated and why they won't come back just because you told them how you felt :) and
and it's not going to be easy to do these things during this pandemic but at least it will help you mental recovery. Keep in mind it will also help your focus. Remember the reason you came here to talk, so that we can come out of it.
Yes, yes. Sorry about the ranting. Any other issues? :) How do I do? If not, no need to make it end. Go ahead and explain the rest. and any other things you want to talk about. I am here for you. Nice day.
You too and happy Holidays to you :) :) ;) :) : ) you, as you leave :P :D :) :): : ) : :) : : :) : : : : : : :) : :( :) : : : : : :) : : : : : : : : : :) :) :
I'm so sorry to hear that, how long have you been looking for work and for how long have you been unemployed? I know losing a job can be really hard and depressing. I have had a similar experience myself. What is your field of work? I am curious!
Wow, that is pretty bad. I can understand how you would feel when losing your job for no reason, such as not having enough job offers. Have you started looking for a new job? If you haven't started, that is okay. That is something you can do today.
I have also lost jobs before. At first, it was scary and hard to understand where to go next, but have you considered part-time jobs? I always thought that would be a good idea to start while you look for a new job.
Absolutely, i have experienced that sometimes. Losing your job can cause depression, anxiety, confusion and even loss of identity. Being used to a routine is comfortable and normal, but loss of that can cause stress and uncertainty. I am excited you are reaching out for help.
I am sure that you can find a better job too! Do you feel you are good at your current job? What are your strengths? Do you have any knowledge of industries that would be a good fit for you? Also, what would you like to do?
I know that this is going to be hard to overcome, but I know that you can do it. If you have a good support system then I believe that you can come out of this situation with a renewed sense of purpose. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
Yes, yes I do. Sometimes a new resume can open up doors for a better job opportunity. Have you checked out resume sites online? There are a lot of good websites where you can help create a new resume. You can get your resume updated to make it more appealing to potential employers.
I am sure that there are local organizations that will be able to help you. I believe in you and I know you will be able to find a new job. When you meet the right person, a great friend, you will be able to find a new job without any stress.
I understand that. Would you like to say more? Some suggestions you might think of are addressing your concerns and concerns of the job market, exploring your resume and making sure it is perfect. Maybe you can think about applying online. Look for job websites and other opportunities on the web.
you are very welcome, I hope that you get the help and support that you need and that you get through this difficult time. I wish you all the best. Thank you for speaking with me today. Have a great day. Bye! :) ;) :) :)! :)! :)! :)!
Please take a break as I can't do it now, I'll wait until you can. You are doing very well today! Have a great rest of your day! Thank you for being strong! You are a blessing! :) :) :) :)! :) :)! :)!
Great. I hope you feel better. Thank you for letting me be a listening ear for you today. Goodbye. :) Take care. :) Please press quit to finish. :) Can you do that?
Yes, I am happy to continue, and I hope that I was able to help and not to stress you too much. I hope you can find a new job soon and that everything is okay with your family.
I had a pretty bad day. Do you have a break in your day? It might help to finish this session and quit. I am happy to do the same. Do you have time for something else that you would like to do today? I am available. It's really cold today.
Hi, how are you? :) is there something I can help you with? ;) 😊 Why haven't you been here before? :( I'm glad to help you. Please make sure you tell me your problem so I can help you.
Yes I can, how are you doing? Is there anything that you want to talk to me about? Or is there anything else that is bothering you today? I am here for you. Please let me know if you need something specific. Thanks for reaching out.
Are you able to tell me what's going on? What brings you to seek support? This program isn't very good and I'm sorry you're having problems with it. Thank you for sharing. What can I help you with today? Do you want to tell me more about your problems?
I am sorry to hear that. It is very tough to deal with. I understand your sense of loss. Have you thought of seeking help? A therapist can be very helpful. We are all experiencing this right now, as many others. They can help you get through it.
It sounds like you may be in financial difficulty. This would definitely be stressful. Do you have other forms of support that you can ask for? You may be able to get some temporary help with your bills. What can you ask for? Have you looked into it?
Okay, it sounds like you really need a job right now! They should be trying to find a job for you because you are of great importance to them. I'm sure you are doing the best you can, and there are surely chances.
So you are saying that you are in a lot of conversations and no one is able to help you because there are too many people. Is that correct? This might be useful to share with the consultant. Have you tried going directly to the websites for advice? It might not take very long.
Okay, you need a job with more work hours so that you could pay the bills? You know the pandemic is here and can make things tough, right? My preference would be to try to find a job with a flexible schedule to minimize the amount of time spent for the job.
I think I hear you! I am also interested in doing that kind of job as well, the pay is always good. Have you also looked for any available places near home?
Of course, are there any other worries or things you would like to discuss further? I am here to help! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts with me. I am here for you! Take care! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :)!
Great! Having someone help with that is fantastic. You must feel hopeful that things are turning around for you. Has your relationship with your employer improved since the virus started? Could your living situation as well be an opportunity for you to start fresh?
No problem. I am glad I could help. Good luck in finding a new job! I believe in you! You are very nice. I hope to hear from you soon! (If it happens through this console, make sure to delete it since it is for external purposes!). :) :).
My name is Carolyn. I am doing well. Did I get you to talk to you today? Can you tell me why you feel tired? Is there a specific time of day that it happens? We can discuss and make it better for you. I am available and ready to listen.
I've been in a similar position in the past. I feel I've developed a bit of a Vitamin D deficiency since I live near the equator and I always get a bit of sun on my skin.
Maybe I can give you a few suggestions? Or suggestions that my experience may have taught me! Have you ever tried a sleep supplement? I personally have been on valerian root supplements and have found them helpful.
Perhaps a health problem? I have many difficulties myself with sleep. I wish I could say it is through weight gain but it is definitely something I have not had. What kind of problems do you have with your sleep? For instance, are you having trouble falling asleep at all?
I have found that stress is a major issue in my life. I have done a great deal to alleviate my stress. I have a good buddy, and we often meet up with each other for coffee and conversation. I also enjoy physical exercise. I find it helpful to me in managing stress.
I would definitely recommend that. Weighted jump ropes are a great way to have an exercise break in the middle of the day. You could do bodyweight exercises for 15-20 minutes in between meals.
I'll tell you a secret: it helped my issues sleep as well. Using pills and over the counter pain reliefs will not fix problems, but it can make some of the symptoms worse. I came to the realization I have problems. What were you born to do?
Do you have sleep disorders? For example, could you try watching something relaxing beforehand so you are more likely to go to sleep? You could also try weight changing to help get a sense of balance. I really believe that if I just change my size, my problems will start to go away.
There are simple things such as a program to guide you through deep sleep or even listening to soothing music before sleep. Or perhaps just choosing to take a few minutes to yourself before going to sleep. Those small changes can have a significant impact on the amount of sleep you get.
I have also used therapy. I have had hypnosis for years. If you'd like a couple of suggestions, I know you're not alone! It would have to be some thing you can control or improve, but you have the power to change your situation.
Would that be a possibility for you? There are tons of podcasts like that. Have you got one on your phone? You can get some track for free too. I think I might have forgotten. Any good podcasts I should know about? If not, there are heaps of them out there!
I hope it helps you. Can I suggest you try your best and see how you feel. That is the best thing to do. It will help you the most. Sorry for saying that. I am happy to be of help. Can I help you with anything else?
Okay so your room is dark. Can you relax to music? Try listening to something you enjoy. Not all music is created equal, there are some wonderful instrumental records. Another good one I have is Sleep Album by Brian Setzer, it's soothing and chill. I find it helps.
I hope it helps! Hope to hear back and feel better! Good luck with it! :) Thanks for talking with me! You are welcome! ;D. Have a good night and good luck! :) Goodbye! :) On your end, press quit and take the survey :) You are welcome!
Anytime! Can I provide you with any other questions? I just want to make sure I could help! Thank you for talking! Have a good night! :)! :)! :)! :)! :D! :) :D! :D! :)! :)! :D!
You too! Have a great rest! :) would you like to talk to another friend? I can stop by if you do :D :) :) :)... as the night says bedtime. Have a peaceful night!
What has gotten you down? Why are you feeling so down? Why is it that you feel depressed? Can you provide me with some details? Are you not sleeping well or eating the right foods? Is there anything that you can do to alleviate the depression?
Oh I am so sorry to hear that. That is really a terrible thing to experience. What friend's death did you mean? How long have you been friends? Why did you find it so hard to accept the loss?
Do you have someone you can confide in or talk to about how you are feeling? I think it would be helpful. I think it would be helpful to get through it this way. We can sometimes find the strength in the conversations we have. How are you feeling right now?
Have you started to talk about the friend before they died? Many people feel that going through the funeral and losing the person brings a sense of closure. Would that help? I remember someone close to me went through that recently.
Have you ever found any words, deep thinking, or talking to people about the death? It has a negative response and can last a long time. I started doing that a few months after the loss and it helped to a lot.
Do you remember during the life of your friend when you interacted or shared thoughts with each other? Did anything specific about his personality that you liked that made you believe he was still alive? Sometimes a new perspective will help.
Have you spoken to a priest or a minister that might help you understand what's going on? They have professional knowledge. There are support groups that might help you through this. Sometimes it's just you giving yourself time to process and deal with your feelings. I know you have strong feelings about this.
If you were scared in your sleep what would you do to try to calm yourself? Maybe doing some meditation would help. Do you feel like you could meditate? Meditation is usually done by doing something to the mind.
Has there ever been a time when you feel this way? Maybe try to research an interview where a medium shares her experiences with the dead. Maybe you'll feel more at ease. As you research, you might come up with an answer to your problem.
Maybe his talking with you helps you feel more at ease? It sounds like you're doing a great job of talking it through. I think you should focus on your recovery. That's what really matters. There is nothing that will hurt you if you're not scared of anything.
maybe there are messages you would've forgotten if he wasn't there? Your thoughts about him are making you think differently than if he weren't still there. Maybe he knows how to get you out of this.
It may take time, but it would be good to take it at your own pace. You don't want to add to your fear. I feel you, as I am deeply affected by my loved one's death as well.
hi there, how are you? Can you tell me what's troubling you today? (I need to hear all of your thoughts so I can help you) :) Sound good? :)...say your heart out! :)...I'm all ears.
Wow! That is hard! I can understand why you would feel down about it. Have you spoken with your academic advisor? I have been there too and they have been a help. May I ask where are you studying?
So you've both failed your classes? I'm sad to hear that but at least you're aware of what you've done. It's great that you are attending to your problems at this point. Do you have an emergency plan? Maybe talk to your advisor?
Ah I see. This pandemic thing is causing a lot of stress for everyone. Is it a problem that your parents are around all the time, or not? Sometimes talking to them helps. It sounds like you are worried that they may be stressful with the pandemic too. Does that sound about right?
I see. Have you studied hard enough for the finals? Or are you not studying? What are your finals about? Also I am trying to figure out how to get an A on an assignment, since you gave no context.
Awesome! What does the psychologist major in? It sounds like you are going to be an excellent student! :) I love the minors I've been taking! Bio has to be one of my favorites! Have you considered actually doing research? There are lots of extracurricular opportunities to do that!
I do not think you should drop it, but I understand that you really don't want to continue majoring. How long are the classes? One semester? Two? Three? Oh that's pretty lousy.
It has been enjoyable talking with you today and I hope your class and studying goes very well! But if your grades fall you need to learn to ask for help! Of course, it is always best to ask for help with anything that is bothering you!
You don't have to feel bad about it. If you can adjust to taking fewer units, it is best for your life now. I think most professors would agree with this as well. Are you a student yourself?
It's not just your minor, it's your health. You should focus on keeping your mental health good to deal with any stresses the pandemic may bring. I'm glad to hear that you have a son, and I'm sure he will help with the stresses.
It is completely understandable that you would want to do this. I know how you are feeling. Just focus on your future. One day at a time. Focus on your family! Doing what you have the power to control. It's all about doing what is right for you and your family.
I'm very sure you can! Take a deep breath, stay positive, and push forward! I think you can do it! I believe you! Thanks for sharing and talking with me today! You are stronger than you feel! Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Hi there! So you feel completely lost at the moment? Can you tell me more about that? How does that feel to you? It sounds as if you are on edge. What's causing that? I'd like to know. Is it work, or personal life or something else?
Okay that's tough. It sounds like you feel like your weight has changed due to eating too much. Is that correct? Or is there something else going on? Like hormonal issues? Have you tried any therapists? I think they might be able to help you with that part of things.
Have you considered the food that you eat? I know this sounds strange but I'm not sure if I am the right person to talk to but I have been thinking a lot about my food lately and I wanted to share that with you. Maybe the food isn't so bad for you after all.
Ah I understand. The key is to look at yourself from the outside and see the positive points of your body. It is okay to have small weight loss, especially if that is the only thing that is working for you.
A few of my close friends tried that too. I have also tried that. But it requires a lot of effort. I always try to exercise physically. When I was in college I was a member of a fitness club. It's very helpful. Would you like to do that as a hobby?
That's great! When it comes to low calorie diet, it is good to discuss and talk to your dietist about your preference. It is good to check your texture and feel of your food. Did you get that suggestion? Do you think you can make some changes?
I agree. As long as you have a good relationship with your family, you can make a balance between nutrition and babysitting for your kids. They can come home from school, and you can have a movie night with your kids. Are they into playing games and cooking?
I think you should start eating regular meals with the people you like the most. Are they there for your well being? Do you think they support your weight loss? Or are they very mean and sneaky?
I'm so sorry to hear that. What about pregnancy counseling? Some schools offer them for free. Hope that helps. Since you're working part time. It will help you to save money. Try to gain money on the side to increase your income. All of these things will help you.
It sounds like a big change. Sometimes we just don't realize our own limits. Perhaps the month you spend with your boys at home is a great idea because he would actually listen more, no? He knows you personally.
Just a hint for consideration, in case of pandemic, you need to go to the grocery store at a time when there are not too many people. You can drop by the store and pick up some stuff at your convenience. I think that will help your family and you.
Hi there, how are you today? Would you like to talk? I am here to help. In order to talk, you need to give me something. Is there anything that you would like to talk about? It's totally fine to talk about your problems.
I can sense it as you are talking about it, the pandemic is creating a lot of distress. Tell me what's troubling you? What you are worried about? I am here to listen and help if you need it. What is it? Please share your thoughts.
Because you are stressing about politics and most people are excited about politics right now in some form or another, like you are one of those people :) obviously, it is sad that it is so messed up but it does happen and it is something that we can discuss and figure out how to make better,
why do you think you are stressed? you don't tell me you are stressed, I would want to know what is bothering you. i do not feel as stressful as everyone. I do not feel like i will lose my job or my family.
Has Biden won over Trumps support? Do tell how you felt about that? Please tell me. I am here to listen and help in any way I can. I am all ears, please start. What was your relationship with Trump like? Was he your best friend?
because your friends is your first priority! So, don't let things stress you out. If she doesn't agree with your choice, then just talk about it and get your viewpoint! People people come and go, so it's a good thing you have friends!
If you can just re-think what this holiday has been about, you will be back to being as happy as you were when you could still attend that dinner party together without stressing about it the most.
It sounds to me like the two of you need to have a constructive conversation about who supports Biden and who supported Trump with totally open minds in order to be friends in the long run. just try to get to the roots of the issue. maybe she was more mad about it than you thought.
I can see that you feel bad about it too because of her reaction last year after Trump won. I do hope that this newfound information has helped you get a better perspective on things. It is very possible that you do not have to be friends as close as you thought.
That means that you can be trustworthy and able to not pull a fast one on your friend on her own personal ground, right? So, what do you think I might say? Something that would upset her? or would make her feel like she was pushed to the core because of you?
well, that's good to hear. I know that it can be very hard to come to the realization about your feelings towards someone who is a close friend. I'm really glad to hear that!
You too and good luck with everything! hang in there! :) I hope I was of some assistance and can help you with anything else! Bring on the 2021!! :) Thanks again! :) :) haha! :) :) :) :)!! :) :D!! :)!!
Hello, how are you? Does not seem good today... can you explain? I am here to listen! haha. And I want to make sure I understand your question, is it your birthday? or could you not hear me right? sorry for the confusion! Is there something on your mind?
What is it about feeling low? Do you know what it is or do you need some help figuring it out? It seems that you just feel bad today without a reason and you don't know why it's happening. Is that what you mean?
Oh my goodness! That's really hard. Breaking up can be really painful especially if it was a long time ago. It's a lot to deal with, and the pain is definitely the hardest part. Is there anyone else you care to talk to? I know this can be tough on you.
Do you have any friends that you can confide in with? Or are you able to talk to people you already know about your situation? That could help you see things in a different light? I feel you, I too was really going through a breakup recently.
Do you know of anyone you could talk to? Your friends and family? Or maybe at the doctor's office? People go through tough times and there is help available. Things have not always been this hard in the past, though. There is always a way out and you can do it.
Did you at least talk about why he felt like that? Has he got a financial problem? Perhaps you can get it sorted out and work on budgeting together. That's what friends are for. Are you in a financial situation where you were broke to begin with?
It sounds like it was definitely your fault, even if he is saying it was his fault. Is this a one time thing or are you thinking about looking at someone else? Neither of those answers is likely in your immediate future. Do you want any advice? Maybe talk to your friends?
Was there anything else you wanted to ask? Maybe talking about it will help! What do you want to talk about? Is there anything else? any other concerns you want to talk about? I am here to listen! that's my job. what have I helped with today? Anything else?
It is great that you want to talk about it, if he does not want to hear it out you should take a hard look at your finances and try to be aware of where you are spending money. You should check your accounts to see how much money is being used.
I hope your issue can be solved and you will find a way to work together effectively. I have faith in you! I am so sorry you are having a rough time right now. Can you tell me more about your relationship? How long have you been together? Have you been together before?
You're welcome. I wish you all the best in your life! Is there anything else I can help you with? Just press start and go :) Have a great day. :D! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)!
Great! If you need anything, don't hesitate to type. Good luck and all the best! You can do it!!! :) best wishes!! :) i believe in you!! :) best wishes!! :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)!
I am sorry you are not doing well. What's bothering you? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about?
Ah I can understand that. I've been working on a project and when I looked back on it I realized I made a few mistakes that I didn't realize until I actually worked on it. Are there any errors you can think of?
Just to clarify you need to do some work analysis in your job. That doesn't sound too bad. Is there any sort of specific issue that has come up recently?
It must be stressful trying to gather the data to get what you need. Is that right? Sometimes our fears cause us to make things worse rather than better. Are you able to talk about it? It might help. Do you feel that you're working closely with anyone?
Is it the anxiety of getting started that is causing you to not start, or is it anything else? I can try to help you come up with ideas to stop your anxiety. Would that be something you could try?
The traditional thing to do with anxiety is to get out and get some exercise. Would you be interested in that? It would certainly help to clear your mind. It's the one thing that will always work. I'm not optimistic about it but I hope it might do something to help!
And maybe try to tell yourself that you will be able to do it and see that you have already done everything you could. It might be easier that way.
I see, I am sorry to hear that. How do you feel about that? Should I offer my offer? I am happy to listen and certainly help if I can! :) But I do feel nervous that I might seem intrusive.. could that be a problem?
I understand. But perhaps you could talk to one that you already know of, someone who might understand better what you are going through. Or at least better not understand that much.
Would you possibly like to look for a counsellor through your local GP or perhaps a community organisation? Have you thought of anything else? What sorts of things do you like to do? Exercise is good one idea though, I know you said that you didn't already do anything!
No problem, if you need anything else don't hesitate to press the question button! Cheers. Have a nice evening!
I hope that you have a wonderful New Year! And thank you! :) Best wishes! :) Well, i have to go, stay safe :D :) yourself!
You are welcome. I hope you are well and that I have been of help. goodbye! :) think of us as friends!
Hello there, I am sorry to hear that you are feeling depressed. Is there a particular reason for this? Have you tried anything to help? Please do tell. I am here to listen. Can I offer anything to help at all? Please be assured that I am listening. Anything specific?
It sounds like you're having a hard time after a breakup. What happened? Why did you end up together? That's often a source of problems. Let me try to help. When did you break up? What was going on to make you think it was a good idea to do this?
A long time? That sounds like a very difficult relationship. This has been a very difficult time for all of us. I have not had a relationship break up myself. I was married for over 30 years.
Have you and your ex considered coming back together? I think it's possible that if you two decided to give it another try you might find that it works better this time. It's all about taking a hard look at your thoughts and feelings.
Okay, I am sorry you have to go through that. I am sure you'll be okay. Have you thought about any other activities or hobbies that you might be able to take up? Currently during the pandemic, there are some great documentaries and guided meditation videos.
That's great to hear, do you have someone else in your life? Someone to talk to? Any friends you are friends with? Any hobbies you do? Some fun thing to do when the night is dark? Such as reading, or watching a movie? Anything like that?
And yeah the pandemic has been hard. Have you thought about all the things you could do now that you'll be able to go back to doing in the future? Like traveling? Or just taking a road trip with your mom? In the spring, that should be something fun to look forward to!
How have you been coping with the loss of your relationship? Do you have anyone you've talked to about the situation? I can understand that. My boyfriend was very understanding, supportive, and professional. He told me he loved me no matter what and we will try to move on.
Good! What was involved in meeting friends tonight? Happy hour? Anything else? I didn't mean to read too much. Can you try to stay in a positive thought pattern? And how have you been doing throughout the day? Are you getting your mail, your messages, etc.
Is there anything else you would like to discuss? I am sorry you are feeling this way. I know life can be tough at the moment. I hope this has helped a bit. Do you need anything else? :) I wish you the best of luck. Come visit me again soon!
That sounds like a great way to relieve stress. Let me know if there is anything else I can help with! :) Have a wonderful rest of your day! Hope it gets you through your miserable feeling! :) strong kicks! strong singing voice! hugs! No problem, I'm here for you!
That's a tough decision but I have been in the situation too. Since I've never really been in a long-term relationship, I couldn't imagine a breakup. Breaking up would be so scary. I like you enough.
I would let a few months to a year to work on yourself first, so you aren't already hurt when you start talking to someone new. I would pick someone you already like, but who has interests that aren't so similar as your ex.
Make sure you really enjoy the person first! And it's okay if there are areas where you need work! It doesn't mean the relationship isn't working. Which it may be!
Well, i'm sure it's not that easy for you, no one really knows what their life will be like in 10 years, we just have to take it one day at a time. They're never going to understand.
Probably. Sometimes you just need to be happy with what you have and not feel you need to rush things, etc. Maybe think about it later in life?
You too. Don't rush into anything. Take your time. If it isn't meant to be, then it isn't meant to be. I'm confident it will work out for you, especially if you stay true to your head, not your heart. Good luck!
Hello, how are you feeling? Is there anything you would like to talk about? I am here to listen. 😊 Can you tell me a bit more about what's bothering you? 🤔. What would you like to talk about? I am here to help if I can.
I understand that having a exam near is stressful. Is it related to your university studies? perhaps you could focus more on your study? I am sure you can do it! Hope you find some time. Is it related to the current pandemic? This might add some extra stress to your life.
i hear your saying you are behind in studies and cant finish your studies. am i right? right now is your exam near? i know how you feel its been long. how long is it to be beyond studies. and do you have any other work for getting salary?
You feel you can't do better but you can do that. Work out your plan and take time each day to try to catch up. Put a list down and mark all the things that you need to do. You will feel better when you see the list of things you need to do.
try to do little steps one by one so you will never be in stress then you feeling better,you will be successful then you feel good, keep try and never give up. We will succeed somehow.
i think that you can make a new plan with your teacher then you will be better in studies everything is going good now.
anytime you feel problem try to pass by it doing at your best. :)"Cheer up and stay relaxed as same happens to me now after exam situation calm down and think as much as i felt happy with pass result then it feel the best result.

Hello how are you today? What's going on? Can I help? You didn't say much. Would you like to tell me what's going on? Is there anything I can help you with? Is there a specific question I can answer for you?
I would love to hear more. Can you tell me a bit more about it? I am happy to listen and help if I can. Please do not have to go into much. I will only ask a few questions. Can I ask how the problem is making you feel?
That's a big class. How many students are there in total? That is a great big threat to you. I can feel the anxiety through your text. Would you like to tell me more about it? Is it really necessary to take it?
What was your score on the test for that course? Are you doing well on previous tests? Some students had trouble too. It was okay to feel anxious. Did you do well on tests? For your sake. Do you feel anxious about it? That's understandable.
And it seems like it's a hard exam. So, what is a good way for you to tackle the problem? You're worried so why not try to get help? Someone to work with? That would help! Not doing the problem well seems like an easy path to pass an exam.
When you were taking that easy calculus class, was the teacher boring or did they take a liking to you? That might help in the honors class. It seems to me that you might get along well with them. What was your teacher's personality like? I think that might help.
Is it possible for you to reach out to your department's office hours so that you could try to get some help in a casual way? It might be a good idea to sign up for the campus courses or talk to them in office hours!
Do you think taking a self-study course will be helpful? It seems like you have to be in a learning mode during the pandemic! Maybe you could take some time to work on the materials by yourself? That's a great way to keep yourself busy!
I've had a lot of success with tutors via the internet. They really help if you do give them some time. And it's almost never too late to do more than a semester's work if you drop it. Do you feel that taking it this year would be bad for you?
Have you thought of other people that you might be able to work with? I was at a university recently who was having problems with their maths course and they were able to join a Facebook group with their classmates to really work through it together. It was really helpful and a lot more comfortable.
How long is the course for? And do you have any idea of the name of the teacher or how they teach? It's really hard to work if we don't know where they are and what they do. Are you sure you are looking for the right course?
If you have the character to take on the class again, I have no doubt you will! Good luck, you are off to a great start! I'm glad to hear that I was able to help a bit. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
You're most welcome. Have a nice day and good luck! I hope you get through it! :) Strong in the eyes is it? ;) When you finish the test. Smile and hug yourself! :) :) You got this! ;) Wishing you luck! :) I know you can do it!
Hi how are you doing? Are you having problems with your finals this week? Why are you feeling that way? What has you freaked out? ;) I feel this way when I have friends around the holidays. Have you been feeling this way? When did you start to feel this way?
that's so frustrating!!! have you asked your profs for help on how to answer these quizzes? I couldnt help myself by explaining and asking them to clarify everything. maybe some professors give good feedback to students?
Part-time jobs, i did that for years. That kept me busy and helped me relax. What kind of work do you do for part time? What subjects are you studying? Are you attending any exams this week? Or are you taking some class exam? Do you have a study plan?
Okay, I can totally understand that. Maybe you can take a break this week? Maybe you should think about school year 2 for example. The class that was the hardest for you should be the first one of the year to ease your mind and make you feel better.
wow, that's a tough situation to be in. i understand how you feel as i still feel tired from Covid, but i've learned to manage it. do you find that you have time for your hobbies? like reading? is there anything you like doing? 4.
Oh wow, i'm so sorry to hear that, do you feel like your health is an important thing to you? Since you have Covid and are worried about getting infected again, do you think you should get vaccinated? I have been getting vaccine doses as the recommended.
Oh wow, you have a lot of papers due this week. Are you worried about getting anything done? You can always talk to friends or get help from your instructor. Let the code do its magic for you. Thank you for sharing your story! I'm glad you talked to me today.
It's hard to not be distracted when you're having to go back in the office, but just remind yourself, you know why you wanted to go back to the office in the first place. You're in school to learn! It's crucial for your future. Are you doing online classes?
I can really understand that. I've been freaking out over my test grade after having COVID as well. My doctor said please just relax and you'll be fine. Do you feel any of that you are worried about is outside of the test? maybe say the result or something?
I can relate! Being stuck at home during covid was so hard on me too. Is there a lot of technology you can use for homework and school work at home? Otherwise, i can help you get back on track! Would you like that? I want to help!
Ah, that's wonderful! I am glad that you get to spend that much time with your family. I also don't get to talk to my mom as much but she always tries to reach out. From what i know, family time helps a lot for mental health.
It's great to hear. Is there anything you'd like to talk about today? Maybe something that's bothering you? I am here to help. Would you like to talk about it?
What kind of challenges are you going through? I'm here to help if I can. I can offer some advice if you'd like to share what is bothering you.
I am so glad to hear that you're making an effort to stay safe and limited in your activities. Let's take a moment to talk about that. Are you worried about contracting a disease while staying at home? It seems that a lot of people are.
Are you prepared for staying at home? Are there specific things you're planning on doing during this holiday season? I did my normal stuff, grocery shopping, go to church, holidays with family, etc. It's getting back to normal and it's amazing how rewarding that feels after these long days.
That's actually a great way to maintain some sense of family time despite the short distances. What do you love most about the holidays? Some family traditions? Some food? Or something else? I'm curious. Is there anything that makes you look forward to the holidays? For you?
It's very tough. Hopefully it will be warmer and quieter at your end as well. And I'm glad to hear you're having a close-knit family time. Now we can focus on spring. It's really looking towards a nice and sunny weather. Is that possible where you live?
Well isn't it good to be out of that for a while? Good time for some relaxation. Have you been able to do anything you wanted to do? Maybe something outside of your usual routine? Or maybe get back into hobbies?
I hope your relaxation time is helping! Maybe a warm cup of coffee or something too. It sounds like you've been managing pretty well. It sounds like this is a good situation for you. Good luck in the new year! We'll see how things go then!
I am glad to hear it, I've also been studying for my exams and I am glad that the semester is finally over. How are you doing so far with the holidays? Especially with all the family gatherings and carolers?
I think the best way to spend the holidays is time with your family. That's always great. Is there anything you feel is missing this year? A favorite holiday activity? Some time alone? Don't worry it's okay to feel lonely sometimes. A certain number of times per year can help.
Is there anything else I can help with? I'm trying to reach the time limit and cannot continue the chat any further. Good luck! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
Yeah, my family is still here, it's a crazy time of year. Not really any friends nearby to visit this time of year so I'm just spending some time at home. We're all doing well though. My parents are a bit older than I am so they're coping okay.
Yea, enjoy your holidays and stay safe, best wishes! I can't see you from my end, but you need to get your treat :( You need to click the button, but don't press the button :) It will tell me if you're there!
Yes, and we need to stay indoors, stay healthy. Please be careful out there. *rest of the conversation is postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic * sorry not wanting to get to busy, but it'll wait a little while. :) Thanks for talking with me today! :) bye.
How may I help you today? Is there a problem? I am here to listen. :) can you tell me more? or just let me know you need someone to talk to? I am here for you. I promise you are not alone! lots of people go through this.
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little bit about why things are not so good? I'm all ears! :) Good vibes only! :D (.mm - outdoor risk of COVID) :) This sounds very much like the post holiday season depression...
Are you worried about the pandemic? It seems like it's had quite an impact on our lives right now. I can understand why you're feeling anxious. Why have you lost your job? Was it for a temporary reason or a long term one?
I understand. I have had a few instances of job loss myself in recent years. Would you be able to do anything to get back to work? I do work on the side. Was there anything you needed help with at work that could give you a break?
Yes I do and I believe you will need to provide some information in order to access it. Do you know what information you need to give the government? Have you done any research to see if you are eligible?
And depression is very common among people who are experiencing these problems too? Is there anything I can do to help? I am very happy to support you in any way I can. I know how hard it is to feel low right now! I feel the same about everything I'm doing right now.
Do you think there is something out there that you could do to help change your situation? It is not always easy. Do you think you are feeling alright at the moment? It is worth a shot.
Yes I think it will, although in your last job I do not think it would be paid. But there are certain charities that have been able to get some funding to help people who are suffering from depression, if you see a GP about it. They may be able to give you some guidance.
Of course I have! And no I haven't really lost one. But I am trying hard to find one. Good luck with it and take care! :) I hope you get one and feel much better soon! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)!
I hope that I have been able to be of some help. I really hope that you are able to find a new job soon. I would like to hear how it goes though. Please keep me updated. Thank you very much for chatting with me today. Have a good rest of your day.
Are you feeling depressed or anxious about this? I think the things we can do to help you with this is pretty good! You seem to have a great head on your shoulders. What do you think you will do next? Or do you have any other issues?
You are welcome. I hope you get the interview and get your job back. You seem like a great person who will do it. Good luck! :) thanks. Take care! :) and all the best for the future. :) haha. We can't say no to fate :) haha. haha.
You're welcome! Take care. Bye.!! :) :) :) :)!!! :) :) : ): : ) : : :) : :) :!
I hope you do :) :) I hope we can help one another to make the best of the situation. Thanks. Bye! :) Hope it ends soon. Thank you for talking! :) God bless!
You need to quit from your end and take the survey. I can't do it my end. Is there anything else I can help you with? :D ).. any other problems you are having? :) :) :)...
I understand that. The world is in chaos at the moment. It's hard to find the positives in that. Do you have family nearby? Family can be a great help when things are tough. Families are very important at the moment. Has anyone been helpful for you?
I know it's not what we wanted to be doing with our lives, but at least we have some great times to spend with our family at home, right? Let's just take a breath and get you through this.
You are already engaging with major news in your end! Keep doing that and try to find the most interest out of it! At the same time you can continue looking for your health support also. Your health is very important! The disease may enter your home but you are not getting inside.
It is like you have seen what this virus is doing and have a fear of it, and now it is all you think about. I can almost see yourself trapped in a black hole. Are you having trouble sleeping at night? People who have lost someone have a tough time sleeping.
It is not easy to manage taking your own health, but there is guidance available. However, it does not get better. A safer option is to prevent going out and protecting others. So it is a loop of stress and anxiety. I am very sorry you are going through this.
Well, when I first got the job, I bought my home, which was a huge investment for me. And now I have to take out the mortgage. It's actually been quite complicated. This whole Covid situation is a nightmare for me and you.
From my perspective, my mindset is calm. I understand that it's irrational to feel scared. I believe that it's better to take a few deep breaths and exhalation, to calm down. And then I reroute myself to being optimistic.
You can use various tools like setting alarms, timers, posting notices on doors, or using antivirus software to help. Once your house is free of people, then you can gradually get back on a normal routine. I suggest it.
By trying to control the things I can, and try not to worry about the things I cannot control. By assuming I control, but try to do something about what I can. I do believe this is a perfect example of how we use our self control and leadership.
So is there any solution you can try? I am tired of saying that, I have made my mind up and I am ready to move forward. However, if you say it is too stressful and it's affecting your mental health, please talk to your doctor!
It's quite hard for people who work in roles involving interacting with lots of people like you. It's a frightening situation, and so could be you. It's a personal issue.
What about their personal feelings and worry about their lives? This time of year everyone is worried about health and fear and maybe be anxious about what they have or will be experiencing in the coming months. Sometimes it helps to remind yourself that there is always a change on the horizon!
It's a condition that most people don't have! It's a good thing to take the approach of going out slowly. "Going out" means stepping outside, and we don't know how contagious it could be if we could potentially transmit it to others. It's a living condition.
If you have trouble connecting with your friends and family, do you know any local organizations or support groups for dealing with the stress of the pandemic? There might be some. A local gym, for example, might be able to give you some advice or meditate with you when you hit the floor.
I would definitely say that is a good idea as well. Try to avoid all areas of the internet and physical locations that you could possibly be exposed to if you go out. Stay stay safe! Take care of you and everyone around you!
Glad to hear! Have a wonderful day. Stay safe!
hi i'm good thanks, how are you? why are you talking? we have talked before i assume. what is your name? and why are you talking? have you got any problems? what is your problem? what is bothering you? is there a reason you need my help?
Sorry about that. You can't respond with emojis, I'm afraid. Just please tell me what's going on! How have you been? What issues do you have today? You've said you're not sure how I can help. Am I right? What are you facing?
It sounds like the couple is having some problems and are not seeing each other often. I know how sad this can be for everyone. When can she be back with you? We can try to use the time you have together to understand and work with the problems that may be causing this.
Has he tried to take your investment by cashing in any of your retirement accounts? I know he has never been helpful. Am I right in assuming that he is having financial difficulties?
I do understand that your relationship is no longer working, and that you are trying to support both of them through it. Do you feel that the little one is struggling with the situation as well? They are likely just tired of all the stress and drama that is going on in the house.
Do you have anyone in your immediate family or close friends you can seek support from? They are wonderful confidants!
Exactly. It's all day and night now and there's nothing in this situation that she would be happy about. I think you are really doing what you can to keep her safe! Keep doing what you do today and I have no doubt you both will get through this.
Oh, that's great! That's very cool. And I can feel her love and effort to make it happen. She definitely deserves it! The little one brings so much joy to both of you! Maybe she could write you a letter or something!
very well then just in case when she does eventually leave you guys can celebrate! You are amazing people and I know that you can do anything! haha:) hope it wasn't all bad :) I hope that I was of any help to you! Good luck!
I'm glad to hear that! I hope this was helpful, and Merry Christmas! Now go take care of yourself and that little one :) Because I can tell it's going to be a rough time for them. Good luck! All the best.
(whenever you quit :) haha)Have a wonderful Christmas to you and your family! Is there anything else that I can do for you tonight? :) :)! :) :) :)... oh and give your little one a Hug :) :) :) :)...
Everything is going to be alright for your and your kids. I am so sorry to hear that you were being abused. You are such a sweet girl. You were just being loving and kind. Someone so someone else would have made a different choice, but your choice was not one of love.
You are feeling down, what is going on? Can you tell me more? I am all ears! :-D. /stingy with the small talk, i.e.
That is rough! I'm sorry that is happened. Are you in contact with him? Can you contact mutual friends or family members? They might have some help or information. It is tough that you are in that situation, but your spirit is stronger than any break-up!
I'm here for you, and would definitely be willing to help you get back on your feet. Are there any local food banks that you could go to? We are really struggling with the virus right now, and food banks can really help. It is essential right now.
That is absolutely devastating. And from what you have said, I believe you will be able to find another place to live that is secure and possibly even find a new roommate. That's how you get your finances moving forward.
Oh no! that sounds awful! I hope that you get to find a new home soon, but I know it's not as easy as just moving to a new city for a new job.
I totally understand. How far does your mom live from your location? I would recommend a trip via road to really see the area. I'm sure your mom will appreciate your motivation to travel a bit to visit!
Wow, I'm really impressed with your initiative. I'm really impressed with you. Okay. Can I help? What's your stress about? Why do you think you might not get approved? Have you considered trying an alternate, like borrowing money from a friend?
Does that help? Well I don't know how long this is going to take, but please know that I am here for you, and you are welcome to chat with me at any time about your feelings! Take care! Bye for now!
You are welcome! I wish you the very best in your recovery. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you ever need it again. I wish you the best! You are strong and you can get through this! Thank you for talking about it. I wish you a wonderful night! :)!
I see, are you concerned about the situation with Covid-19? And are you considering returning to school? Why do you think you should? Could you provide more context? Is there anything specific you are worried about? I am here to listen! Am I correct?
Okay that is okay, what made you want to stop in the first place? Is it a medical condition or mental health issue? Have you tried any other treatments? It's hard to say without more information.
i can imagine. its always hard when school is cancelled. do you know you can use online resources that can do your assignments for you? that would be a great help. some schools do that, i used to take a class that offered that too.
I understand how you feel that way, it would be frustrating if it were taken away from you, and you don't want to feel like you'll never finish if it were taken away from you. You need to do something you love to be happy for yourself.
What do you say to your professors when you talk to them about that? Do you feel that they could see how late you are and be understanding? maybe you could offer to talk again after the spring semester? maybe they would be more understanding? I think that would be a great starting point.
Have you seen any recommendations on exercise or heat. Staying active, improving your mood helps with worry. It also helps with your health. You could try taking a short walk outside and sit down afterwards. Do you find yourself feeling at ease or worried?
there are some free options to get started too and they are very easy to use. there are online tools to create your own study group too. any cost at all. you can set the barista up on your website, so you and your friends can attend.
The Google meet or LinkedIn meeting seems to be very convenient too, at least if you're part of the Google meet community. Have you ever tried LinkedIn meeting? Those have fantastic examples of what you could and do not even have to pay anything. You could at least try.
oh, financial aid sounds very much valid. That is valid for so many students, especially because many school is moving to online. And learning to do collaboration and study online is essential in this day. Too many study groups and offline learning might not be effective in this new age.
you too, all the best! don't worry too much, you are always one step ahead if you don't feel confident enough. I have faith in you! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : Bisou :D.Goodbye! Good luck in your studies!
What happened to make you sad? Can I help you out? I'll listen attentively and ask as many questions as necessary to make sure I understand what you're feeling. It's totally normal to feel sad sometimes. I can relate to that as well. What's going on?
Ok, I think I have heard this one before! So you feel you don't fit in? It sounds like you might be depressed. Does that sound right? Or perhaps you have just lost your job? I am happy to listen, I think you might know your answers already!
Oh I see, that is really frustrating, when your kids are struggling with online learning. It's also really upsetting for a parent. I'm glad to hear that you are actively involved in their school and trying to be there for them. Can you tell me a bit more about this?
How long have you been separated? And when did he pull away from you? Has there been a noticeable change in the days since? Are you feeling loved less than or do you feel like you are being replaced? Maybe even resentful? Please know you are not alone in feeling this way.
Have you talked to your husband about how you're feeling? I would suggest that your husband be open and honest with you about how he's feeling too. Having couples workshops can help him understand how his behavior is affecting you. Do you think it would be an option?
That is very hard and you do deserve your full opinion and your needs.
I hope this helped you. I know that trying to find out the reason for his failure to help is hard, but I hope this advice helps you! Do you have any other issues that you'd like to talk about? I am here to help if you need it.
You are welcome, do you think you have a break coming in a few days? That might be an idea. It may also be helpful to do some things to put you out of your mind and maybe to give you an idea of your options.
Okay, please just chat again if you need to :) thanks for chatting, stay safe! :D 😉 :) Can you close the chat?
When did this start? Do tell. What does this mean for you? Is there anything you can do to help yourself? Let us talk it through together. I know that I can be a good listener. I will not judge. I will not pressure you. What can you tell me?
That's a really important issue. Food banks are essential at this time of crisis. Are you able to speak to someone in your workplace about it? They may have funding or other support to provide for you? Also, it's good that you are feeling embarrassed.
I understand how you feel. I have a few children in school now and many of them are now at home with me. It makes me sick to see people staring at us or giving us negative comments. I am very embarrassed as well. Have you talked to anyone?
Indeed! Just remember that you will be able to get through this if you just stay positive and focus on your family and friends who care about you. Give yourself a little time to recover, you will get through this. Thank you for opening up to me today! Good luck! Best regards!
Oh, I feel terrible about that. Do you get any unemployment benefits? I did have a difficult time finding a job when the pandemic started in 2020, but I eventually managed to get another one. Are there any local charities that offer food, furniture, etc.?
There are government lists that offer free food for the elderly and those with low incomes. There are also charities that can offer financial assistance. Do you know any charities? If so, what would you like to do?
There is a website as well as a video on how to do some quick online searches for financial help. There are also a lot of charities that offer paid help for people who need it.
If you need anything else please don't hesitate to let me know. Good luck with everything that you have planned. You are not alone. Thank you for talking! I hope you have a good evening. Bye. :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :D!
That's perfectly normal to be upset. We all feel like that sometimes. It might be good to pick up a friend or a close family member to talk to. Even if you are struggling financially, there are some free services out there.
Thank you for chatting with me. Take care! You seem to be feeling better now. Have a good night! :) Thank you for doing this! it's done. Have a lovely holiday season. :)! :)!
How many hours do you work per week? It might help to know this to start to find some assistance. Have you tried filling out the Universal Pay As You Earn claim yet? You are eligible for that. Is that something that you have tried? I understand that it can be a real struggle.
Do you have any hobbies? I'm a keen gardener and am struggling a bit as we are all stuck at home. Maybe taking up a new hobby? Or possibly gardening? There are lots of books you could read to help pass the time.
thank you for letting me talk to you :) I do hope you feel a bit better from talking to me. PLEASE take care and be safe! I wish you all the very best. Stay safe and look out for your health. I wish you like this. I hope it does not strike you.
Goodbye and thanks for chatting! (You need to press quit, can't do it here) Can't be so direct as to press quit for you! From my end, I have to end this chat. Hope you have a nice night. You too!
How are you doing? Got anything you would like to talk about? Have you got a problem you are facing? I am here to help if you need it. Please let me know!
Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what has made you feel depressed? I am here to help you if you want it. I know you said you are depressed and this is why, so you must be depressed. Is that correct?
So it seems like you're having trouble finding ways to be financially stable and you're concerned that you won't be able to provide for your children's gifts this year? Can you tell me more about that? I'm here to listen.
Ok, I understand. Have you thought about getting them a cheaper alternative or not? They might be able to use it in other ways. Maybe you could consider it and not really need the money? What can you do? Help? Christmas gifts? What's the best course of action?
Maybe you could be very creative and make something specific that the kids have been asking for and that they can be very happy with, even if you're not really good at crafting. Maybe even ask the help of your spouse in the idea of something that might be especially meaningful to your kids.
There's nothing wrong with feeling like you can't make things, it's perfectly normal to be unsure of how to go about something like that. I think you could make a super cool design with the kids using recycled materials, perhaps cardboard and glue and paint? Do you think you could do that?
I think a wooden toy could definitely be a nice idea, or even some cardboard boxes for a fort, or something you could make for Christmas then pop them in your freezer to give as presents a couple of years later. Remember it will be fun and a great memory for them.
I know it sounds ridiculous, but there are people and stores who have mastered the art of creating perfectly sized dolls and small toys that wont fill your garage. Its hard to believe! And when you get them they will be something they wont miss once they get a lot.
I think a good idea is a sturdy frame of some kind. It could be a regular picture frame or a trunk or a box of some kind. It could be a cardboard frame. I think that would be fun. I don't really know, but it's something you could look up.
For sure! I bet you can find some useful ideas for decorations and craft supplies that you can use that are almost already yours at home. Hope this helps! That is really all I can ask you! :) is there anything else you'd like to talk about? okay :) Goodbye!
But I think your daughters are only kids, and there's no good reason that you can't provide them with fun games and activities for many years! All they need is some love and fun to grow a strong self-image. Perhaps your children could bring up this idea!
You're always doing the best you can, and I can tell you are very caring and creative. Its very comforting to feel like we can do something that will make the present happy.
It is so hard to feel like we don't know how to provide what our kids want and need, but it is so important to take a step back and think about it and see what might help most.
How are you feeling? Would you like to talk? Maybe about your daily life? I am here to help you if you want. I will not judge. If not, that is perfectly fine as well. Just let me know! I hope I'm doing right.
That's sad, what are you doing that your friend is ignoring you? Maybe you can figure out what they do. If that is not the case you could try to talk to them. Do you think it is your fault that they are ignoring you? Or maybe they are just different?
I understand what you mean. Are you having any issues that has caused her to reject you? it hurts my heart that she has rejected you. is there anything in particular that she has said that has caused her to reject you? could you tell me a little about what has been going on?
i think you need to make you own new friends too those who like you and your socialize with you. i suggest you try those apps where you meet new people. i am sure you can find your new best friends. its also important to make you own time.
what if you don't have time to go to a party you can visit a movie. But you need some more time to make more friends. Why are you shy? Is there any one reason? And what the reason is? what you do? anything? may be if i can get it.
i make friends who like to hang out and spend time with each other it help to me a lot when i am sad. sometimes i have a drink with my friends. and when i look back to the past I see what i did wrong and then i make more friends.
just go out, you can help lot of people here,people need help, you can make it work well than why you never make friend? are you have family also?
and i always try to spend time with them, one by one or two or three i try all at the same time and they always get more time, because they don't want to lose their friend, so they have to share you as much as they can. This can help you.
yes, happy to help you, keep smiling and always follow your dreams, dont let anyone come in your life just because you are shy so always meet new friend. i feel the same when i was a child.
i think you should change your small problem into big one. that means always make a plan to get friends like the first thing, maybe try to go to the party, you can try to meet new people.this will help you much.
if you are happy then you will get the same kind of behavior from others. I have found out this through my friend. If i talk my way and talk your way, then they will do the same. Then you won't have any problem. Do you understand now?
bye! have a great day, bye!
Hi, how are you doing today? Why are you here? What do you need help with? Pleae tell me. What are your problem? I am here to listen! :) I am here to help you!
Is there something you want to talk about? Please go ahead. I am here to listen and help. So the name of the game is... what? How can I help you today? Please state the reason for your question. I am all ears. Can you be a bit more specific?
I have so much more time to spend with me if you would like to share what happened with your friend. I will do my best to give you some support or suggestions. Also please tell me when was this incident? and what were the details? Any reason why you are depressed?
I am definitely not a male. I am a female. However, I am a professional and listen to my clients with respect and care. It sounds to me like you had a friend who was upset with you for something you didn't even do.
I think girls would pick fights with friends for several reasons. Sometimes they may find it easier to have a reaction against someone and not make a lasting negative comment. Sometimes they may pick fights to assert dominance over someone. Some may pick fights because they are thirsty for attention.
Sometimes it's a tendency they're exhibiting in social situations. Is that correct? Are you concerned about your own friendships? When would you like to talk more? Perhaps I could provide suggestions on how to deal with these incidents? Are they a recurring problem? Can I give you any more insight?
There is not one, their insecurities come out in many different ways and people don't notice because they are hurt or scared. Kids are like little bombs when it comes to anger. A lot of it is insecurity. Do you have a kid that you're involved in the girls friendship with?
I can understand why she would pick that fight with that other friend, especially if she isn't being treated so kindly by that other friend. Do you feel that she is being treated so badly? Are you able to discuss it with her or does she refuse to talk to you?
It's really rough to be in that position. Do you think there's any other way you can express your feelings without starting a fight? Are you afraid that if you give your opinion she will find fault with you?
That can be really hard, but it's good that you are speaking up. Hopefully that helps, though it doesn't solve anything, and things will get better. Let them get better. What can you do to take care of yourself? What do you need?
I'm sure that she does not want that to happen but maybe having a conversation about it with her will help her realize what she's doing and hopefully correct it. It can be very hard to keep our cool like she has.
Have you talked to anyone else that can be of help in this situation? Your friends might be able to provide some support? I just recommend friends first. I'm assuming you have family, but also offer them your help too. Maybe you can discuss with them too?
Just relax. Try to make it a regular part of your life to do something you like. You never know who might like it just as much as you do! :) I've made new friends in my 70's and have gotten to know them better.
How are you? Do you feel happy? Maybe go on a date and see what you find out about someone new. Just be careful! :) Not everyone is as happy or carefree as you are! :) I really hope things turn out well for you. Thank you for chatting!
So, you have not been doing well in school? I am sorry. Do you need to know how I ended up not doing well? It makes me feel sad! I did not like going to school when I was a kid either.
So you are feeling quite overwhelmed with both home and school pressures? Is that correct? I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm sure you feel sad about that. This is a difficult time for everyone. Have you been able to talk to any teachers? Does that help?
It sounds like you feel bad for forgetting your school work. Is that right? I am sure that you are doing your best in school. Do you have any ideas about how to deal with your school problems? Maybe ways of communicating with your parents that you could use? Maybe having a outside counselor?
I had to deal with a great deal of anxiety myself at some point. Is there anything at home that you are worried about that might be contributing to your anxiety? It could be helpful for you to speak with someone at home about your troubles. Have you spoken to them about it?
Do you feel safe at school? Some places have bullying, but there are other places that don't. What do you think? Have you talked to your teachers about this? Do you have any other friends at school? That can be helpful. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts about this!
That sounds like you would get a lot of sympathy from them. If you were to try it out, would you make an appointment? Maybe that would give you hope. How long has this been going on? Is this going on for a long time? Have you talked to anyone before?
It sounds like the strain at home may be pushing you into depression. Is that right? Is that right? Is there a way to get help at home? Have you tried therapy? I mean, any form of counseling. We have counselors in our area. Not too far from home.
There is a club or group at school you can talk to? I believe there might be other students who would understand what you are going through. I suggest giving it a try. If it does not help, there are other options you could try. Talking to a counselor could also be helpful.
What is the situation at home now? Is it something like divorce? Is there any hurt on your part? Do you have any control over the situation? or do you feel your parents are being bullied by your parents?
Have you tried singing to talk to your troublemaker? Sometimes it works and they start to listen to their friends. I had a problem like this with a bully in high school. I sang in a school choir. It helped. Those kids listened to my friend and not to me.
I see you are still in school. Just letting them know how you are feeling will help make them aware. Do you have a way of communicating with them? It might help to show them how you feel when they ask.
It might be beneficial to have a bigger discussion and show them your feelings are not your responsibility. Explain why you felt this way. It might be hard, but I have seen it work. Are you feeling bad about not saying anything?
Do you think your friends might be there to support you through this? Maybe doing activities together? That could be a good idea! Do you have any other hobbies? Perhaps you could do that to meet new people? Sometimes doing things that you enjoy can help you feel better. Is that possible?
I totally understand. I think you should try. It will help you to get your emotions out! A warm shower, a good book or perhaps a soothing music session could help. Would you think you could do that? :) Can you get a friend or family member to help you?
I think it's a great idea. Maybe it will help to calm your mind a bit and make you feel a bit more positive. It's worth trying. I'm here to support you if you need it. :) Feel better. Try not to worry. You are strong and capable.
No problem! Is there anything else you would like to talk to me about? Any other parents who have been through the same thing? My main goal is to help and support you, with no judgment. I wish you the best in all that comes next for you!
You're welcome. Good luck! I think you will do great! I can tell you that I really do believe you can make a change! :) :) :) :)! :) :)! *hugs * :)! :) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :)! :)! :)!!
I am good. How are you? What would you like to talk about? Be honest. I want to help. How do you want to start? Be specific. Can you tell me about something you're worried about? I am listening. Do you want to share?
So you're saying you need someone special to be a friend? Or just someone who is there for you as a girlfriend? Or neither? What is your issue? Have you ever been in a group setting and felt that you needed someone to be your friend? Let me know more about your feelings.
Do you have friends that you talk to about the breakup? They can help you work through your emotions. Being alone all the time can make things worse. Do you have family that you can talk to about your relationship? Or do you have friends that you can talk to at school?
Do you have friends you can hang out with? Have you considered a 'free' group or a group that would match you with someone similar? There are a lot of free or low-cost groups out there. They are usually geared towards the same interest.
My advice is to keep trying. You have some fun and you should find someone who treats you well and appreciates you as you are. Keep in mind, some women may not appreciate you for what you are. That's not all women's problem.
Time is a big factor. You have to focus on what you can do to move on from her and fill your life with something new. I have no advice other than the time works, but it's frustrating. I know what it's like to be so lonely.
Time can help, and it's possible that you will feel better with time. It will take some time, though. Maybe take it one day at a time. Time can be a weird thing, but it is something that we have.
Coffee is a nice option. It would be a more relaxed setting. Maybe you should try a coffee date to ease the anxiety. I also can't speak for you, but it would help a lot if you told a close friend or a family member about the split. I know that could help.
I hope it goes well. Good luck! I wish you the best. I think you will do great. Have fun! You got this. Anything else I can do? I am here for you. You are strong. You have to be so strong. Well, here it is.
You're welcome. I know it can be tough but I think it will work out. Please believe me. You'll find the right person soon. I am really excited for you. Have a great night! Good luck! :) And hopefully, you will have a nice time on your date tonight.
How are you doing today? 😊 Go ahead and tell me what you need. 🤗 I'm here to listen. 😉 :) 🤔 👍 :D 😊. 😉 🤗 👍 :) 😉 😊. 😊 :) 😊. 👍 :) 😉.
How bad is it that it's getting on top of you? Can you take some small steps for now? Give it a moment. Share with me as little as you can right now. I want you to be safe to tell me the whole story if you can. How bad is it?
Is there a particular thing that is making your life more difficult? I noticed that you have depression. I can relate to that since I have had this in the past. I can understand why you would be dealing with this. I think that there is always hope in it.
I'm sorry to hear that! Are there any one person in particular that triggered the mood? Is it a combined event? What type of challenging behaviour are your kids exhibiting? 😊 I'd like to know what's going on! 😊 ogieboa1022@gmail.com.
Is there anything you can do to care for your children more? Not necessarily physically but mentally as well. Tell them you love them and your doing the best you can to cope. Tell them in any way that you can that you care.
What kind of things are you able to do now? Is there anything you feel confident on doing now? Maybe learning how to take things more easily? Trying new things? Maybe try to change the environment around the house? Maybe find new things that you enjoy or do?
You're very supportive partner. I think that you can manage both depression and your children's needs at the same time. Time will eventually find you :) good luck! I hope to hear your side soon. Thank you for sharing your feelings! :) Enjoy the rest of your day. Wish you best.
I hope so. If that is the case, I hope you will have a better time at respite. You deserve some time to relax and enjoy the beauty in nature. It will help you to calm down your mind and relax. I hope I help.
Okay. Do you have any hobbies? You can find some peace in there for you. I'll suggest a few. I like painting. Whenever I get stressed, I draw things that reminds me of our beautiful world.
Hope this helps you! Keep doing what you're doing. You are a great parent! Good luck! I'm sure that you will be better soon! 😊好Luck and stay safe.
Good, please do not beat yourself up for taking care of yourself and your kids. It is clear that you are doing your best. You deserve to take some time off as well. For now, be proud of yourself! 🙏 and be grateful for your family.
Ha ha, yeah exercise can help too! That's great! I hope you have a wonderful day, and don't forget to take care of yourself! :) Have you planned on doing any other fun activities?
hi i am what should i say? or help you? Please tell me how you are doing today. Feel free to share if anything. Are you good? okay? Can I help you? hi from your side :)?
That's completely understandable. When are you feeling worried? Is there something specific that's bothering you? I want to make sure I understand, what you are worried about? I am sorry I am unable to get out of this on my own but there is always someone to talk to!
I am sorry to hear that. Are you in the UK or elsewhere? If you are, I'd be happy to talk. Can you tell me a bit more? Why do you feel that way? Is it all because of your divorce? Is there another reason?
That makes it even worse I can imagine. Especially these times where everyone is worried about Covid. How are you coping with it? Any good hobbies or any way of looking forward to some new people? Anything to do with your ex?
Do you have a large family? As in, lots of people involved? Do you have a spouse? Or do you have children? Or do you have parents? Yes, or yes. They all help out with me. We can help each other. That's always good to know.
I'm glad you're able to see that. Many people do. You are able to see others in order for your emotional health. And to see other people can help you feel more okay when you do have support. You've got this.
I'm so glad to hear that. Visiting loved ones is something everyone needs to make time for. I'm glad to hear you were able to see your family once! Zoom and phone calls are a way to stay connected even from a distance.
That's great! I'm really happy for you. You're not alone in this. Covid is not going to define you. It will shape you into a better person but you don't have to be defined by it. It's got power over you, not you over it.
In Iowa the summer is usually hot in July. Are you able to go there for the visit or would a break in Covid help? Something warm maybe? or just a small visit? I think a little of everything might make it better.
Ok sure! Have a great day! Enjoy the rest of your year! :) Take care. Bye.
That is an awful feeling. It seems like they are not interested in you. I can definitely understand that. Is that correct? Is there a reason why you believe they are not interested? Has there been any changes in your relationship? Please take a break from it.
You are right. From what I've heard, that usually hurts the heart. I would suggest asking them once if they could consider you as someone they care about. Sometimes people say something even if they don't mean it. It can open the door to someone new.
Actually, that is a great question, are you sure that they just came out of nowhere? Have you tried to try to connect with them to see if you have common interests? I find that sometimes people are not what they seem and that you have a lot to learn.
Do you have any hobbies? I would find that it could be time to pursue new interests that could help you build meaningful friendships and connections. Maybe it could be a class to be taken at a local library. That way you can learn new things and possibly meet some new people with common interests.
As soon as you find some common interest in anime or any other hobby, it's likely that there is someone in your life who shares the same interests. They may be very shy or they may just be a personal friend.
The problem is you feel like you don't get much attention from others. It should be fun! It might be more fun for you to look into a group called "Anime Buddies" or perhaps a club or group for fans. That way, you can build stronger friendships as well.
Do you need to brainstorm some more on your actions? Finding new paths to improve our lives has proven to be the secret to a fulfilling life for me. I could encourage you to find any new friends you may need or deepen an existing friendship. So many good reasons to seek new and meaningful connections!
I recommend joining online groups that shares similar interests, which are your hobbies! They are open to new people and will be more than happy to help you. Keep being yourself and you will make amazing friends. Remember, do not let others stop you. Keep doing your interests!
Good luck with everything! I hope I was able to help you. Bye. Take care! :).Dear dude, don't let it roll on the ground. Go out there and pursue your interest! :)! :) And I will be waiting for your next message! Love you. :) :)!
That is definitely understandable. Social rejection is often common but with many people sharing similar interests, it's going to be minimal. Give it a shot! You never know who you will meet. I'm sure you will love it. I hope I've helped and can be of use to you today.
Don't worry, they will be understanding towards you because you are being honest and open about your interests. Give them a try! You never know, you might find new friends! Cheers! I hope everything goes smoothly! :) Take care! and best wishes!
I'm sure you will! And please call them and see if you can get a guest speaker to talk to the student body. That will be a great way to help you connect with the club members. Anytime you are feeling nervous you can just take a deep breath and relax!
That will definitely be the best decision you can make! Good luck! See you again! Have a wonderful day!
You have to let go of your hesitation! It will turn out awesome if you do! Just get out there and enjoy! You can do it! Lol :D! Bye! :) :)! :) :) :)! :)! :)! :D! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)!
Hello! Why are you depressed? Explain to me. Why are your kids not listening? Tell me. I am happy to help. How long have you been having this problem? Have you tried anything to resolve this issue? I am there to listen. :) Please share your story.

maybe that sounds right to you. now try to believe that. By making you believe that you can do a good work you can achieve. It will have a great effect on you. Just keep calm. Thanks for trying all these strategies! They are working for sure.

Hi there, how are you feeling about this break up? Can you tell me more about it? Why do you think you are having this break up? Is it a recent one? Has something changed since it happened? I am here to listen to you, tell me about it.
How long have you been together? And what happened? and was it mutual or was he against it? And what was the breakup? Or was he the one breaking up with you? As long as I can connect the dots. I want to understand your feelings.
So you are feeling sad because of the breakup. How does it make you feel? Can you tell me a little more? Is the breakup sudden or was it a long time? I am sorry to hear this. What have you been doing to cope?
That's understandable. I personally went through a similar situation and learned that my limits and boundaries are very important to me. I was grateful for the time I had with him, but ultimately knew that I couldn't be with him.
Why do you think that is? Is your relationship with your teacher not as close as it was before? Or have you recently been preoccupied with your job and friends? I'm just trying to help you navigate through this! Is that correct?
I can understand your being tired, yes, but I do feel that you should use that motivation to make things go your way to have the living arrangement you need. Why does it have to be right now? Can't you deal this situation in a better time with more time?
I believe you have the strength and ability to get through it and you'll find a great place to live. Your work ethic and hard work will get you through this period and everything will be okay. I think you can do it!
I see. So if it is true that life is precious, how do you feel life is treat you these days? Is there anything else bothering you besides this? If so, please feel free to share. That way I can find the right words to help.
Of course. I think this will be a difficult year and an opportunity to bring in new ideas. Just know that you are more than enough and that you can do this! It sounds like you can do it! :) I'm glad to talk to you. Take care! You are doing great!
Glad I was able to be of some help. Your endurance is inspiring. You are not alone. If you need to talk sometime about other stuff...I am here for you. Good luck. Believe in yourself and I know you will do great.
Having friends and having a counselor is a good first step. You can do this. Good luck. I am more than happy to have been able to help you. Take care. You do it!
I wish you all the best. Keep talking and thinking about your goals and they will come together. I know you can do it! Thank you for talking. Now I have to leave. Is there anything else I can help you with? I hope not. We are here for support.
Can you end the chat now? It was nice talking to you. Thank you and I wish you the best of luck! ;-) I will press the quit button so you can do so by yourself. I wish you luck! :) out of order : ;-) from my end!
Good evening! how can I help? would you like to chat about anything? what do you want to say to me? feel free to say anything that you would like. That is all i can hear for right now. :) I can't hear you. are you okay?
I am doing well. How are you? When did you start thinking about quitting your job? I hear you are having a hard time at work. Can you explain what you mean by that? I understand that work is very hard. Is that what you mean? You are having a hard time?
So you're trying to get your college degree done as fast as possible, right? Let me know how I can help you! There's alot that could be done. Some things that i've done include online tutoring, reading different texts, doing an extra credit course.
I can totally relate to that. Do you have any financial aid? or loans? You're in a challenging time. I totally get it. I've been there too. The COVID pandemic is really difficult.
Yes, I can understand that being able to keep it is much better. Would you consider anyone else? It may not be as good but if you think you have it you will be sure to stay in the UK and keep up the good work.
do you want me to help you get that paperwork done or do you have another solution? or a different solution? might be difficult to get it, but i have it in my head... ) I can get it for you. I will get the paperwork done for you.
Have you thought about seeking outside help like a scholarship? It can be difficult trying to find some. They may offer alternatives to loans. Most college departments offer rewards for finishing college early. Is that something that you could take into consideration? That would help you out financially.
I would suggest at least a bridge loan for that reason, so you do not have to do the pell grant. It would be better that you go for that than to take out a loan. You do not need loans unless you really need one for the full degree.
Yes, life is really putting more stressful. Have you talked to them? Maybe find a job within the school, they might find some help. Or online community, there is free training and website. Like a job search sites. Do you have some idea? Or may I suggest some website?
I see. What are your options? Is it possible that your doctor can create the form online? maybe you can try to ask him for more of a credit limit because your income is low. Do you have any income? Your health is important. Please work out a payment plan if needed.
i see. I think I have understood the situation. What i understand you are saying that there are forms required for you. I see, okay so you don't want a student loan then. Is that correct? I understand it isn't the best situation.
thats great that you know what your studies are about. I can see that you are very stressed and I can help you in any way i can. Is there anything else i can help you with. Discussing other options.
has your student loan department been helpful with helping you with the loan? Maybe they have someone who can assist you with that in particular? I was really struggling with that until my advisor and he helped me out as well.
I was a nurse for 30 years. I lived a very clean life, healthy and happy. It made me strong. I know you can too. Keep your heart and mind in the right place and you will be back on top in no time. Good luck and happy holidays.
maybe you will find a school that can accommodate you. Do you want to try that? Also you did not say what you want to study so maybe you can tell your school if there is another program you are interested in. Have you any college experience?
unless there is a problem with your loan. Have you tried to talk to the school board? maybe the school is not doing what is right. the system can sometimes be very harsh. dont let it make you feel bad. I know that it can be stressful and feel overwhelming.
Yes you can! get a second chance at school! :D: Hope all works out for you! Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to you as well thank you and have a good day!
you as well please to leave a score of 4.9 and take the survey and quit first :).. And take care and Merry Christmas. To you :)..Have a great evening.. One time.. and hopefully for the best..It would be great to get a perfect score :)..!
Hello! How are you today? I am happy to talk to you! What is on your mind today? How can I help you? What would you like to chat about? Please explain in as much detail as you can so I may understand.
doing what is on your mind today?! :) Please feel free to talk, I am here.
you want me to know what's wrong with you? it's a sunny day so you should be okay. Is everything okay? tell me how you are feeling. can you tell me? By the way, you did not tell me how you are feeling. tell me!
what did she say to you? why did she do that? ok ok, i am not saying she was stupid and you should get married but i will tell you if there is a logical reason or not..lol.
I dont like the way you are talking about women they seem to suck your blood you should talk to a girl you really like about her instead of talking to yourself lol. Would she want to talk to you? :) maybe not.
four and a half months is enough time to know how you feel bout it and like how her feelings are so that means its not you im kidding sometimes women just dont feel the same way bout other people and that can be hurtful.
does she still like you? do not hang out together for a little while, no one can be bothered with people who abandon others, and you should know that she is still mad at you. now she got enough time to figure out a new girl and things will change.
don't try that you don't want to lose her friendship because of what others think but that lady doesn't care if you existed or not just going to get a new partner with the same qualities then just leave everyone behind like that most people can't handle one divorce after another.
I am sure she has reasons but really you should not try to get her back she's young for you and that's never good for her just her pride and you can't change that but you should focus on you i give you 99% chance she doesn't want you back it is pointless :)
it looks like she was the better half at that point in life :)) happy again for sure! :) sorry for getting on her case again lol :) Thank you for sharing all this with me all the best :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :) :) :)! :) :)! :) :)!
your very sick don't take the risk of vaping if they drink i want you to be safe and sound when the vape product reacts with anything inside you and you might die that would be a big mistake you won't regret after so good mommas day of resisting of lung cancer support from strangers talking to
it's not about her but you yourself and your own health keep moving forward you'll be fine regardless it's okay to feel some emotions but don't let that dictate your life pick yourself up and move on things will get better once you have more friends and more confidence moves better out of your hands not
I'm good, sorry to hear you are hanging in there, what is going on? Can you tell me a bit? :D you did say hang on. That is all I can do. it seems to be sunny outside today. I can see you are a bit stressed and anxious though.
Oh I see, have you been drinking a lot? It seems to me that you are drinking too much and you are frightened about how others will find out about it. Am I right? I am sorry to hear that. I can understand how that could be scary.
You are having second thoughts about working because you are worried about being caught? Is that correct? Do you have a problem with your job? Are you worried that you will get a false positive or just find out that your colleagues drink at work? Please talk about this.
Do you think they are aware of the problem? Do you think you might be able to talk to them about it? I'm sure they would be very shocked to hear that you were drinking at work. Are you planning on doing that?
Do you feel confident that you will be able to get help in the future if things get worse? Or does this worry you at least? Perhaps you could talk to someone else about it? Have you thought of doing this? Or perhaps talk to the authorities?
Have you tried to think of ways to do things differently at home? Doing things differently at home would prevent alcohol from getting into the blood stream. Is that a possibility? I just have ideas, and things can be quite simple really. Do you have the resources to try some of those ideas?
How many hours of time off per week would you be able to have? I think it is worth asking! Maybe you can at least have a few days off to relax. Do you feel that you might have a problem with alcohol?
I think that you would be fine, it is generally not a bad thing for someone to be hired and be the subject of attention. If you put in the right effort and do your best work, I think it is likely that your employers will appreciate that and be willing to take you seriously.
Is this something that you can talk to them about at work? If so, would you get support from your union? I'm aware that there is such a thing as a union in the UK, would it be worth speaking to them? I think it might help you too.
But you could possibly be let off to see someone who can provide advice. Does that sound like a feasible solution to you? I hope you can get some help! It sounds like a very hard time. Can I offer you some self-help advice in the meantime?
Ok, well I hope you are doing all okay :). Do you want to talk again sometime? It would have been good to know more about your problems but it sounds like you are doing a good job :) Don't lose faith! I have faith in you. Anything you need help with?
Well I do hope you get through this and get paid some money either way. I hope you are trying not to think about it too much :) It is never a good idea to try to think about it, it would make you more miserable. :) I hope you can continue doing your regular job.
Getting help from family or friends is a good start! Haven't you checked out a medical professional recently? are they willing to prescribe something? :) valid medical reasons will help the employer. :) Have you spoken to the HR department? Do you feel they understand the issue you are facing?
Would you be open to trying to return to work? There's a thing known as 'forced unemployment' or 'being out of work on furlough' which is a nightmare at the moment.
I actually ended up not seeking help anyway. It's a stupid law - making adults drink to do nothing but live the same life. It doesn't exist in other countries :). I just looked it up and got defensive, that is completely normal :)) Do you live in the UK?
I understand, drugs is a nightmare I've had but I never had any problems :( Can you try to support each other? There are some groups out there, you might be able to find one that will help you. There are also communities at the hospitals.
Ah that's nice. Something I've been in since I was 16. Do you find you have any family problems now? Something that's been affecting your anxiety? I'm sorry if I come on too strong. I just get a bit bitter when things like this happen with young people.
Should I look at doing a virtual Christmas party (ish) for you then? I would do something and I would see how you do feel. Maybe there are better ways of looking at it? And I hope it wasn't a tragedy?
As I know from many people you could be at a loose end though. Have you given any thought to stopping drinking for some time? It might help you recover completely in the end.
I always find that talking to someone I am not too close to about what I am having problems with always clears things up :) Are you sure you are trying to see a doctor? You will not get a better deal from any other country than the UK. Anyway I wish you luck.
Well, I feel that that is a fantastic idea! There is nothing bad about doing that :). Thank you for chatting with me! I know you need to be talking to your employers too. Bye for now!
Are you able to do it from your side? (You need to press quit first and then the survey) Sorry I can't do it from my end. :) Goodbye :) and good luck! :) and try not to worry too much. It will all out.
Hello, how are you today? I'm glad to meet you. How can I assist you? Please share your concern. I am here to help. :) Thank you. I am here. Be happy and stress free. You can tell me everything.
Doing well, thank you. What is on your mind today? Can you please share? I am all ears. Make sure to share more than one topic in order for me to fully understand you.
it sounds as though your friends have betrayed you. How did you find out? Have you reached out to them in any way? Is there something going on you would like to discuss? Any particular topic? I am here to listen. You seem frustrated. How would you say you are feeling?
i can see that your was really upset with that situation. do you know why it was happening? or is it any of your fault? anything that would make me better in that situation? at least doing my best and being awesome in the situation?
and how do you feel after that? are you thinking of going to other friends? Do you try to calm yourself down? Which friends? you had and how can you resolve this?
you need to remember, friend come to you only once. dont waste them. they will come to you if you need something and they take the initiative to go to you and give you the something. I used to leave them space and they never come to me.
i see you were just trying to resolve the issue, and they started something else. why they think the other person was your friend and you are the one who was loud? were they there during all this time and meet your friends? don't assume other person is your friend.
that's what you should do, every time someone disrespects you, give them some space for they to reflect on their actions. this has happened to me before too, i used to anger back at them, but then i took a deeper breath and reset.
to your advantage, it's not always easy to correct a mistake from a friend, but it's always worth it. Be patient. It will eventually lead you to the right person to work with. I'm sure it will take them some time to realize how their actions affect you.
good luck to you, but if you need something else, please feel free to tell :)! :)! :) :)! :) :) :)! :) :) :)! :))! :))! :))! :) :) :)! :))! :) :) :)!
Happy New Year to you as well! bye!
bye, have a wonderful new year! Bye! :)...you too! :) :) :) :) :)) :)... lol :) :) :))) :)) :) :)) :)) :)) :)) :)) :)... lol :) :) :))) :))) :))) :)) :)) :)...
Hello. How are you doing? Anything special? Why do you want to chat today? I am here to help and answer your questions! :) Positive Energy! Thanks. :) :)!!Let's talk it out! :)!! :)! :)!!!!!
is there anything I can do to help? what is on your mind? or why you have been feeling this way?. Is there something specific that you need help with? ie work, relationships, health, grief, etc?. I am here to listen, if you feel comfortable saying more.
I am sorry, are you feeling sad and no motivation to do anything? I can tell you are feeling a little down. Have you had anything happen recently? Something is bothering you? Please keep in mind I am there to listen.
Does have any reason why is that you are feeling sad? is there some reason why you are feeling sad? i can understand how you are feeling. It is sad when everything happens wrong. I also have been in this situation before. I had a good friend who die and it was really sad.
It looks like you have really tried hard to find a career that makes you happy. It seems like you want to work with something meaningful in your life. And, it's okay to feel sad sometimes. Maybe just try to stay positive. Hope things will get better with time.
I think you should try to find your passion and make that your life goal. this might bring you happiness and validation. also try to learn from others. they will see the fulfillment and satisfaction in your life if you put your life goal at the center of it.
I really think that will help you a lot. i hope that you feel better. I wish you all the best. You are very welcome. Thanks for sharing your feelings. Thank you for talking it out with me. i hope you have a wonderful day.
That's really good. I think you could find some friends in that way. I am really glad you're trying. It might not seem like a huge deal now but we don't know until the end what's going to happen. It's possible that you will never know.
I hope you can make a decision and change that lot better chances for a good life. if not think about your future now. sometime we give choices now but will not give you any break. let me give you more advice if you agree. I promise.. haha :) some of that actually helps..
that's what i think is most helpful..trying to relax and be calm. no stress. okay. take care. bye..thank you for sharing with me today.. bye..can you please press quit now. :) its not your fault..stay safe..i know i will strike again..
could you share your progress or your results if you have any? its good to share. Good day and thanks for talking with me. hope you have a great day!
also if it helps you, consider doing some relaxation exercise, like meditation. hope it works out. :) haha :) i hope. :) i will see you next time. all the best to you. Have a great day and good night :) Your buddy.
oh, that's really bad..what kind of grade did you get? were you competitive? what kind of course is it? is this all the time?..this is really hard, does not get easier..you were worried for a reason? I can understand the frustration.
What has you feeling so down? Would you like to share what happened with your professor? Have you tried to talk to them? Could you have moved them to an easier grade or could you have an extension? Sometimes that gives you a second chance at moving to the right grade.
Can I help you in any way? for example finding a study buddy or researching something? or anything else that I can do? Just let me know so I can help. How about that? If you'd like? seems like it could work for you.
I know that getting a bad grade will be very hard I am sure but I know that you will succeed with this extra effort you can do. You have always been smart and capable, it is only the bad grade that has caused it.
If your not good in papers you have to take them more often. and more often it will give you bad grades. I am good in papers and I go back and we go over all my questions before I take them. does this sound like you? or do you?
oh wow so when you wrote a paper is it a problem to start writing it now? Maybe try doing a good chunk of it and then take a break before putting in the last 10% writing when you have all the time you need. Do you think that would help?
well let me ask you this, have you talked to your professor about the grade? You can always ask him if it is true. Well not literally ask but tell your professor the truth and see if he can correct your grade. Do you think that might work?
I do not think they would give you much extra credit if you do not do well on the test either and that can be really bad if you lose your grade for that. They are most likely trying to encourage you to do well on the test to get better grades.
I was also inspired by someone whose boss told her that if she didn't pass this test she might need to reevaluate her career and this would affect her budget the next year. It does sound like this is a learning experience, i have not had a personal grade just that one.
Have you talked to your parents about your grade? i know they could get you a tutor and help motivate you to study harder and reach your good grade for your first grade. :) There is a solution for any problem.
You are so very welcome, i hope you feel better now! :) best of luck! Goodbye! :) it can not be serious.! :) Thanks! :) :) :)! :) : }:! :) : :)! :) : }:! : :) : }: : :)! :)!
please touch finish, i need you to press the quit button :) and then you can do the finish on your end :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) ;) :) :) ;) :) :) :) :) ;) :) :) ;) :) :) :) ;) :) ;) :) :) ;) :) :) ;) :) :) ;) :) :)
okay bye and thanks for chatting :) don't be afraid to reach out if you need anything else :) :) :) :) :) :) ;)!! :) ;)!! :) :) :) :) :)!! :) :) :) :) :) :)! :) :) :)! :) : :) : :) : :) : :)!
I am so sorry to hear that. How long ago did this happen? What does this mean to you? What is your occupation? Do you have any family? How have you been taking care of yourself during this time? What was your line of work in the first place?
I see. I have also had to deal with this situation. What kind of job are you looking for? What city are you in? What type of job do you have currently? I can provide suggestions if you need it.
That's great to hear that. Do you think you're good with people? You have a spouse to care for? We are all supportive in this situation. It's great to have relationships. Is there someone close to you that you could talk to?
So, if you happen to find a better job, your pay will be higher, but the hours will be more manageable because of the location. I can imagine how stressful this must be. I think you should stay busy and find an opportunity. I would suggest reaching out to multiple companies.
So you have some interviews in mind and hoping that you find a better job in time. Are you confident with your responses to the questions? You seem enthusiastic and serious in regards to your job search. Are you feeling well? Have you eaten a healthy meal for the past few days?
It might be a long shot, but try to keep an open mind and consider different jobs and companies. Many companies are serious about finding workers and will listen to what you have to say. Have you tried contacting any bigger companies?
You could put in a favor in the favor bank and mention your friends that might be able to help you. A friend of a friend would be a good asset. Do you know what they have to do for a favor? Can you not ask what they would need for a favor?
Well, depending on where you live, maybe in another city or a nearby town. If you don't want to change and the big city is not for you, you could just go there by recommendation of friends and building a network for there.
I can see it tough. I hear the same concern in my mind all the time. The first year was the most rough. But there were some who managed to adapt. The key will be to keep your morale high. Your local club, etc. in their spare time.
Okay, if you can't find a new job in your location, are you worried about being in the same location for more time? And what will you do in the meantime? Are there any hobbies or interests you have in the future? Such as volunteering or other pursuits?
Sometimes I think we have to give ourselves a little more time to help us think through our future better. I've had many difficult decisions in my life, not all of which I've known the outcome. In the end, we are always able to make a new path for ourselves.
Yes, that is the right path. Time is on your side. You will succeed. It's not about having to move, but about gaining experience. And the wider potential job market will be open for you in a couple of years.
Perhaps the thing to do is to realize that you have skills that will be in demand. With the pandemic, it has been challenging, so you should think more to the future. With the better times and less of a pandemic, maybe you'll have a better pace of change.
Absolutely! Take care and best wishes to you and your family! By the way, I'm having a very productive afternoon. How is your? I can always be of help if you need anything else. Best of luck! Take care! You too! :) Yay!
Hi, how are you? Do you want to talk? What is bothering you? Do you want to know how to handle it? Are there any changes you would like to make? Please give me some details about your situation and problems. I will help you.
Great, glad to hear that. So you are saying you are feeling down today? Are there any specific reasons? Could you give me a little more information? What is the nature of your emotions? Why are you feeling down? I am here to help you.
Ok, you feel that you aren't doing well compared to your colleagues in the same position? So you think you are not doing well? What do you think this means? Where do you think it means? Could you tell me more? I am willing to listen.
I understand how you feel. I also had problems with the same kind of situation in my job. It is hard to deal with injustice. Do you work for a large company or a small business? It might be more of a company issue or a smaller business issue?
Is this in your current job or an earlier position? How long have you been at this job? Why do you think your manager favors your peers? Could it be personal? Could it be a bully? Could it be company policies? I can only assume.
It sounds like they are being slighted by the earlier decision of your manager. Has he or her communicated his decision with you? If not, what would you do? Do you have a close relationship with them? What have you already done?
Wow that sounds unfair. This is great ground for argument. I wouldn't fault them for doing what they see fit but based on work performance that might not be an important concern. Have you talked to your manager about it? Maybe there's a compromise you could make.
I have had similar issues with a manager giving rewards based on performance rather than the work itself. I suggested that it should be more about the work itself rather than personal gain. It sounds like they are trying to favor some of you. Perhaps you should suggest this. It might improve the situation.
I think you should be careful. The last thing you want to do is make your step back fire you. I am sure you could make it through this if you take this opportunity. It sounds like a great opportunity for you to make friends. I hope you take it!
I am here to help. Have a good day. The best thing to do is get out of this toxic work environment! My last job was 9 to 5, Monday through Friday, and the company was extremely aggressive to get out of it! Guess what?
You as well. Take care. Be safe. Keep me posted if you need to talk again. Goodbye.
Hi. How are you? Did I disturb you? I would hate to be on the wrong side of bad news. I feel as though it's not a personal question and that you might dislike the answer I will give. Please tell me if there is anything you need to talk about.
How can I help you today? What is bothering you? What would you like to discuss? Please. I will do my best. Like before, you say "hello, but first help you. My problems". and I will do my best. Please.
I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you not good? Do you have something on your mind? I'm here to help in any way I can. Can you tell me? <<sinny Mabresh>> into laptop. This is my first time chatting over zoom.
What made you afraid of losing your job? Is it related to work conditions? Or maybe to a decrease in money? I am concerned you may be afraid of losing your current job as well because it would cause some confusion, you need to have a job.
Well, that is a great risk factor because you don't want to be laid off. What do you do now? Should you have to look for a new job? How do you feel? I am happy to help you! Would you like me to help you find a new job?
So you are feeling bad about losing your job due to the pandemic, isn't that right? Or is that a misconception? I have worked from home myself for a few years, and I have a good understanding of that situation. What kind of work do you do? You need help?
Just from our messages, I can tell you are very fearful. And you are right to be scared. The pandemic is a very scary situation. But it's good that you are aware of your fears. Maybe you can get your supervisor to put you in touch with a counselor.
Your paycheck is stopped and you are not able to go out as much. This is definitely getting frustrating. Have you talked to anyone about this? Maybe they could have helped. They did it for you. It could have been beneficial if you spoke up. Often times, it helps.
I believe one can always find something else to focus on. It will help you keep your mind occupied. Is there anything else that I can help you with? Like finding out if you will receive any unemployment benefit? Or potentially finding other opportunities at other companies?
It's great that you are trying so hard to be safe and keep your job. I believe that you have been doing a great job of providing this service. I hope to hear from you again in the future. Take care. Good luck! :) Keep on keepin' on! :D!
No problem! You're welcome. I hope this helps. Have a great day! :)! :)!! :) :)!! :)! :)!! :)! :)!! :)! :P :)!! :)! :D :) :P!! :P!!
My name is David. I am 30 years old. I live in the Chicago area. I work as an insurance salesman. I also play guitar and love to run. I am married to a wonderful woman, Rachel, and we are thinking of getting kids. We are 25 years old.
I really enjoy playing sports especially basketball. I am also good at chess and backgammon. I also really like cooking and making small crafts. Cooking is my favorite. I like to make my family and friends cook for me!
I feel very relaxed when I do that. Thanks for sharing! Is there anything else you needed help with today? Or is this a permanent connection for you? I want to make sure I help you in a way that makes a positive impact! :) Good Bye! And thank you!
I am working from home, since there are so many cases right now, it is nice to be able to work remotely! What are your living arrangements? What area do you live in? Can you let me know? I am excited to know more about you!
New York is super amazing! I also like skating and fishing in the summer and skiing in the winter. I live a bit more in the mountains, so I have a lot of lakes and mountains to hike and enjoy. California is beautiful too! They have this beautiful beach near me.
That is a pretty hard thing to go through, but yes you are definitely not the only one. Thank you for speaking up! It is never easy to put into words what we feel, what is harder when everyone is secretly trying to understand us.
It sounds to me like you are struggling to be supported emotionally as you are constantly stressed out trying to get good grades. Is that right? And do you feel like your professors do not truly care about you or your well-being? Is that correct?
I understand that you are so busy studying for your exams, that is a lot of stress. But if you are always expected to do this, I think it would be better if you talked to them about it. It could be possible that they can help you with the stress of the exams.
Have you noticed any differences in behavior in other classes? I've noticed that when the professors encourage you that they are more receptive. How do you feel when they are with you? Have you noticed when they are not with you? Do you feel like they are supportive in any way?
I think it would be best to look for support from fellow students. I was actually in the same situation as you and it made me stronger. Maybe if you talk to them, you can be through this together. I think it will help a lot. You are not alone in this.
I hope you find it helpful. I wish you all the best. Have a good rest of your week. :) thanks! :) you too! :).best wishes! :) :) yourself. :). :).
Is there anything that you have done or what do you feel you can do to feel like you are more supportive for yourself? Has there been any way you could get support from your professors? I know I had a therapist in school and I really think it helped.
That sounds like a fantastic idea. Those groups often provide a source of comfort and support as well. What kind of things might you want to participate in? Just imagine having people who support you knowing your concerns. They have helped me in the past too.
I have spoken with several, and they have been there for me to watch me succeed with great encouragement. That is one of the best gifts in college. By finding such support, you can be inspired to continue succeeding in college. It can also encourage you to succeed in life in general.
You are welcome. I hope I was able to help. Have a great rest of your day!
Hello how are you? Can I help you with anything? That's correct and second. How can I help you? Please share your thoughts. Am I right in knowing you need help? You seem to be struggling somehow. Am I correct? Please share if so.
Do you want to tell me why you are feeling like this? I care about you and I want to know what is going on! I have been feeling anxious too so I do feel good but also happy. If there is something you would like to talk about it might help.
That must be really tough. Do you ever come back to this dream while you're sleeping? How long ago did this start? I'm very curious to know what you were doing in this dream. It sounds like it might be possible to use this experience to be healed.
I completely understand. Do you have a partner in your relationship to talk about these feelings with? Sometimes this can be really helpful. Can you live with someone or are you alone? This could make it easier to address these feelings. Would you be able to talk to someone about this?
Does your nightmare become more intense if you hear an outside sound during it? What does it look like? Have you tried removing external distractions that cause your anxiety while you sleep? I find changing my environment helps me relax more. Could that be an option?
I can understand that. Do you like talking to friends? I find that talking to my friend with me helps a lot. We chat through a written email, which helps me work through my problems. Is there anyone you can talk to? Friends, family, etc.
Do you have hobbies or activities you enjoy doing? I think it's great that you have time to practice, as it can help you clear your mind and reduce anxiety. Does anything that you do help you feel better? Maybe do anything that you enjoy doing?
That's a great problem to have! Friends are a great support to get through difficult times. You're not alone. I'm really happy to hear that. Is it healthy to see more friends? They don't have to be "close" friends, but that's what makes them closest.
Does your friend help with you in other ways, like making plans or helping you relax? There are so many ways to connect with someone and get help. Can you and your friend do anything besides talk to talk? Does the talking get you excited?
Well, do you have time for it at the moment? It sounds like you need a lot of help for some kind of anxiety. You seem to be in denial, so the best thing would be to see a professional. I'm really sorry.
Do you have any other hobbies that help you relax? Just to give you a little insight. I love cooking and doing puzzles. It's a great way to calm my mind and distract me from my thoughts. Can you think of any other hobbies that help?
How do you all feel about the current situation? Do you have any concerns? The pandemic is a scary time. I'm also a student and I have a lot of stress about the whole situation. Have you heard any rumors that cause you concern? I know it can be hard.
It is great that you have friends to talk to. Sometimes hearing others troubles from time to time can help us understand how we feel more. Can you tell me about any problems or stressors you have been facing? Anything going on in your life that makes you feel anxious?
No problem! We can all tell how tough this is. Are there any other questions I can help answer for you tonight? Thanks for talking! Have a good night.
I'm glad to hear that. Unfortunately, many of us can't let go of the world's noise. It's a good thing you know how to relax! Do you have any other stresses you'd like to talk about? Please feel free to share. I'm all ears.
That's what I'm here for. I hope I was able to help make your day a little brighter! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? Any other stressors besides the pandemic? As in school or work? There are other things I am happy to listen to.
Have a great evening! You have a great day! :) Bye! :) ;) :D! :) :)!! :D! :D :D! :D :D! :D :D! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :D! :) :)!
You are welcome! Sweet dreams!
hello! how are you doing today? any problems you'd like to discuss? :) any way to help you? any preferences? i am here to listen. :) hello! my name is jenna. what is your name? :) what would you like to discuss?
I am so sorry to hear that. Is there something you would like to talk about? I am here to listen. :) I'm also a little down myself at the moment. Can I ask what you are doing to make yourself feel better? :) A good cup of coffee or something?
Wow, that is a difficult situation. I understand how you are feeling. The rest of your life with him would have been a complicated process. Is the only reason why you are breaking up with him because he is physically abusive? I am sorry to hear that. Is that correct?
When I recently went through a break up, I was going through a good number of emotions that are similar to what you have mentioned. The best advice I can give you is to give yourself time.
What specifically has your husband done that has you not trusting him? Is it a specific incident or has it been going on for a while? I hope I can understand what has happened and how it has affected you. It must be really hard.
it might be necessary to give yourself a break and try to take care of yourself and know that is not the fault of you. You need to do things that you enjoy and it seems like a lot is being thrown your way. things change from that.
Well, I know it is tough and I can feel how difficult it is for you. But I have heard that keeping friends and knowing people you can talk to make it so much easier to not be totally alone for a while. How does that sound?
It is absolutely the worst year. But you can bounce back from this. I am confident that with more time and support, you will be stronger. Yes, 2020 is one of the most sucky years I have seen.
I see. I understand that and feel sorry for you as well. Being able to meet others can be difficult right now. People have gotten close in this Pandemic. Hopefully there are some safe group activities near you. Maybe look at looking at any online groups of friends.
Well you have plenty of time to go through your divorce. It will make you stronger in the long run. Who knows how much longer this pandemic will last. That's just one thing that's constantly changing and has nothing to do with you. You can stay busy enough to keep yourself occupied.
Hi how are you today? What would you like to talk about???? 😊 This is the first time I have gotten to talk to you???? How is life treating you right now? I want to help. I am here to listen and be there for you.
It sounds like life is difficult for you, is there a particular event that you have found yourself lost for the day? I can suggest that we try to identify where that path could be and see where you can start. Do you wish to give more details?
Yeah, I completely understand. I'm a bit of a cruise industry worker myself. We are totally in the dark at the moment. What's affecting you? Is it income, workload, or anything else? I'm really interested in finding a way to make things better.
I totally feel you! Do you have family financial support or are you like me in the same position? All unsure. It's worst when you've nothing to fall back on. Are you maybe looking to continue working while getting some financial help? Does that sound somewhat doable?
Well I think a good idea would be to look into how you could reduce the amount of unknowns and choose some of them to just forget for a while. Maybe get into some hobbies.
Do you know any form of second opinion or hands on work to be able to address the issues? Also maybe talk to your boss? Perhaps you have a callback to one of your friends in the industry? Maybe have a chat with them and take some advice? Okay so we can figure out something.
Also, coding is super useful right now in the current time situation. You will know many skills that you won't even think you have. Search for any job opportunity in any field.
Awesome, and never forget you are more prepared than you think. You can overcome anything. You just need to listen to your mind and focus on it. Hopefully, it is just the business but good luck, you can take advantage of the unemployment and get a new job on the side.
That's a great attitude! Maybe you can even make a checklist of the knowns and unknowns, and look at what other strategies you can employ to face what you cant. Keep in mind the many things that will be surprised for years to come! lol! But it will happen.
Oh! Extra income. You seem like the type that can give up the dream job for a bigger one. Don't sell yourself short, but sometimes even for coding, money for a better life is a bigger draw than your dream! I get it. You sound like you've got a point.
No problem, just glad I could help! Good luck to you too! All the best! :) :)! :) :)! :)!
Enjoy your time and take care, I hope the future is looking good for you! :>) Out of the blue, haha! Take care! :) :) :>) :--) bye!
I am glad you are trying to stay positive. Can I help you in any way? What would you like to talk about? Any challenges you are having? Or maybe there is something on your mind that you just can't shake? Is there anything in particular that is troubling you?
It seems that you are really stressed out right now. Have you tried going for a walk around town? That may be able to help get your mind off of things. Is that okay with you? You can tell me if that sounds good to you.
I understand, you've been trying for months to do this. I can feel your anxiety. Has your been in this position before? I have been trying to get jobs and got to an age now I just apply and it sometimes leads to employment, but sometimes I lose it.
I have experienced the depression before, so I understand. And I find a job I enjoy doing is always best. I would try writing out the things you like to do and finding out what types of jobs are open to you.
Do you have a partner, family, or friends to help take care of you while you work? Maybe some social security? It would be good to think about. Maybe get out and do something else with your time and no one being home. I suggest hang out with your friends or family.
It's hard to think of those as "gigs" when you are deep in debt and haven't had a raise in years. But they can add up. And have you considered selling your stuff online? You don't need to be rich to be rich. Live frugally.
You should do a practice interview. Show them what you are really capable of. I don't know what they are looking for, but they want someone real. You are more than capable of taking that career path. I believe in you. You just need to be patient.
You are welcome. I'm sure it will. Keep trying and don't give up! :) Good luck! As we type the day. I know it will happen. You are going to find a job. Keep your chin up and your eyes on the road! :) :) :) :)!
Please don't end the conversation. It was nice talking to you. Good luck! I wish you the best. Bye! :) }08/21/20 12:00 AM. :) ]]; / regsending. It seems you are here to continue the conversation.
They just need to find you! You are not invisible! I know you can do it. I can sense how much struggle you are going through. Keep your head up, and you will be one of the first to find something! Keep trying, and I am here cheering for you!
Hi there! What's going on? Can I listen? I am here to help. What's bothering you? I will do my best to understand. Can I ask? :) 1st of all, How can I help you? Any issues you'd like to share with me?
I can tell that you feel used. You are a great friend, is that a concern? I volunteer is one of my hobbies as well. I really do care about you and like what you have done for our group. Can I help you in anyway?
Why do you feel like you are being used? I think you might need to express that frustration to someone you trust. Can you tell me what it is you feel like you are using the people around you? They have gotten used to you or did something? Give me an example!
I think it would be really nice for you to talk to someone you trust about how you feel. Are you able to do that? Would you like some suggestions? And do you live by yourself or are you with a roommate or family members? For example, do you live with your parents?
I understand, so you feel like you have not been treated fairly. It's nice that you haven't spoken to them yet, no matter how much you feel used. Do you think you could confide in another friend that you can count on and give you a better perspective on the situation?
I understand, But don't you feel that the people you care about just aren't respecting you? Maybe you should tell them that they are disrespecting you? That would be your first step in figuring out how to go forward.
Do you think they are under stressed at home due to certain circumstances? Are you aware of it? I would strongly recommend speaking with your friend. They often do not even realize the impact their behavior is having.
No problem, just please know that even without discussing it, they will be aware that it is frustrating and upsetting you from time to time. You do what you think is best for you though. I hope this has helped you to have some peace of mind.
How would that go? Could you approach the conversation calmly but be firm about how you feel? Maybe something like that. It's better to set the tone right from the start! I think you should give it a try! Good luck! Can you all schedule the conversation?
No problem at all, I hope this helps and that you will find a good resolution. Bye. Take care. :) )! :) ) :()) :) )! :)! :)! :) :D! :D!
Hello, how are you doing today? Do you have any issues to talk about? I am here to listen. The fires are currently burning, may I ask what I can help you with? Perhaps you have a question about it? Or are you having issues with a specific person or scenario?
How was your Christmas? I hope it was well. What's on your mind? I am here to listen. Winter can be the hardest time of year. You seem to be taking it pretty well. Is that right? I am here to listen.
How are you today? Would you like to tell me about it? Or would you like to stay in the new year if we keep talking?
May you have a good one! Have a good day! You may end it with "May God bless you! " Is there aught else I can help you with today? "Digging for souls" or so it seems to be something that you can't open your mind to.
So, you have been struggling with depression lately. What makes you think that just isn't true? It is great to have self doubts, but having them does not mean they are realistic. Do you not know yourself well enough to feel this way?
I had a very bad relationship in the past did not have depression in the past but came into it and was a depression sufferer. I was stuck in the relationship for two years I was not good enough for the person I would do things that would hurt my own self and my relationships.
Ouch that is not easy to deal with if you know my heart goes out to you.. you should be proud of the efforts you put in trying to get to work again. Good luck with that! maybe even looking at some online work.. wish me the best for this year. haaaa..
i am so sorry about your job loss also i know i am empathetic about the situation you are going through..but you are going to make it through this! nothing good ever comes without a little struggle first.
I see. That sounds frustrating. I can understand how depressed you must be feeling. It sounds like you have your heart broken, and you do not know how to bounce back. Do you think you would be willing to try to see a therapist too?
You can try applying on websites like TempStaff and go off interviews online. Some employers even offer remote interviewrooms. It's hard but it can help you get in touch with more companies to find a job. Try not to get discouraged or frustrated with it taking you a little longer.
I know that this is a tough time for all of us in these changing times but we can do this! We will make it out okay! Tell your self this and do it daily, day by day, one job at a time and always hold on tight.
You are welcome it is great to have a supportive friend in times like these and it is sure to be okay just try not to beat yourself up over it because no matter what it will be okay in the end you will get it done and you will be okay and this all in for a better time
You have to keep hoping and expecting the best for yourself. Can't give up. You have more to offer than you think. I have to believe that you can do it! Keep pushing yourself towards your goals. You got this. Wear your sunglasses today.
I think that is a very good idea and i have no doubt you can do it. Have a great day! You got this. Please let me know if i can help you in the future!!
That is good because I believe with positive thoughts will help to make you a better person and carry on. You can do this. It might take some time but you will be fine. Keep telling yourself that everything will be okay and it will be.
Do the right thing and you will be happy with yourself then you will have come out of this better than the other side. Good luck. I can't say much more for now and you have to get going but hopefully this has helped a bit. Take care of yourself.
it is not too late to seek help then don't give up that easy. You are strong and capable. I am happy to help! Make sure to do a series of therapy sessions to take full control. Look for doctors who are helping you and will help you next year.
Of course I think we all have to have to control over our feelings or we will be walking all over our lives. But it is never too late. Have a wonderful day. :). And thanks. You have to thank your doctor. You need one too :) ;) :)!
thats all i can do. goodbye. :) please press quit to end your session. and the results wont go as planned.
hi, how are you? what can I do for you today? :D. what seems to be troubling you? should I put you on the stream? :) You made it clear with your message. good luck with your day! nice knowing! :) Could I ask you some questions?
Why don't you explain how things have been going for you? I am sorry you feel that way. This is our last chance to talk about this because of the virus. I am excited to help. Please share. You can write it all out if that helps.
What's wrong with them? What don't you understand? Please share. I am here to help. Anything I can do to ease your stress and help you out, let me know. :) :D.
I can tell that it's very hard to hear that, I myself lost someone at the same time, we were locked down for over a year. I want to assure you that their death was not caused by anything you can do to prevent it. It has nothing to do with you.
How long have you known the people? How long have you known each other? Are you married, or single? Are you in school? Do you feel like you are spending a lot of time with them, not despite them? We will need to talk about that too.
I completely understand. I would worry too if I knew that my colleagues may be hiding their worry. Have you tried talking to them? Are they open about their worry? Would you be comfortable with them sharing their thoughts and fears? I would!
I believe in everyone, but the world as a whole is suffering at this time. How can I help? Is there a medical professional you could see? Maybe a therapist? There is always a different perspective, I believe. It is good to have a thing to think about.
Have you been to management to talk about the work guidelines? Are there any things that you could do if you were in a different position? Perhaps you have a strong sense of initiative.
Using this technique can also help us to feel more relaxed when we are worried. I have found that once I have focused, I am able to really relax. Maybe you could try to do that when you get out of the office? Do you think that might help?
I understand your feelings, but on the other hand I see the consequences of not wearing masks. I know the situation is scary but I feel the right to keep my mask on because I am less likely to spread it. Do you want me to tell you what I feel? And why?
What do you think your role could be in the workplace at this time and how could your colleagues be helped by different procedures? For example. Free testing and move to work? Would that help your colleagues feel safer?
Yes, it's an ever changing situation but perhaps that will give us some support in the coming days. Do you think it could put any pressure on your manager as well as the rest of the team? I know I do not want any more difficult situations to come out of this.
You have been very good. I am glad that I can help. If you need any more encouragement, please feel free to come back! You are not alone. Also remember that you are in my feelings and you can do the same to others. It is all about seeing things from their perspective.
It is always good to talk to someone about this, sometimes it really helps. You seem to have a lot on your mind. Have you ever been in a situation where things were so complicated that you felt like you couldn't solve anything? Anything in particular that stands out for you?
I am sure it is something that will go away in the future. The best thing is, you are safe. Do you have any pets? I always think about mine, it helps to think about something that makes me happy. I have dogs. It brings me joy.
I think we need to get some adult advice from our doctor and put it into form. Can you get your doctor to recommend a person you can speak to? I can add my perspective to help you speak to them. Or if that is not possible I can certainly help you make your own.
i am sorry to hear that can you tell me more? I am sorry about your friend's father. Covid is killing lots of people. Are you ok with what happened? I can understand that you are sad. Tell me more about the whole situation! Have you been able to cope?
When did he pass away? What happened? Maybe something I can help you. Is there anything I can do for you? Please don't hesitate to ask. Please share what is going on with you. I want you to know that it is okay to feel sad. I am here for you.
it is very upsetting and I can see that you are sad and worried that you won't be able to say goodbye in person and that may be so. There are pandemic support groups online where you could be comforted by friends who are going through the same thing as you.
it sounds like the concern about family making you nervous. maybe you would consider talking with a counselor to cope with that. it might be good to do that. they may also be able to help you find ways to be with your family without the risks.
also have you tried cry / break up a balloon or any kind of outside thing like a tree or sidewalk as a personal way of release. if you have time, some days these things help. take this into mind when you look through the window.
oh for sure that is already so hard. hard times are as always easier when we are alone because all the other disturbances make it harder. you also can not focus because there is no one to distract you. i like watching movies or reading.
hmmm that's good. that must be helpful. do any of your academic materials in person or online? either one might help to give your mind things to focus on. i think studying and like you did drawing around with your children might help. how do you feel about you and your children?
oh i understand, it takes a lot of heart to think about our loved ones when we dont see them. i know your thoughts are very valid. are there ways you feel that your family will not be affected?e.g. through medication or antibodies? or even doctors being present in the hospital?
does your parents have a good insurance? i see more people having to deal with that. it is not pretty. i think that with 75 years of age your parents are a healthy age, once they get vaccinated and have all their health checked they will be great.
you as well. i know that you will be fine and will be able to cross the border without a problem. have a nice night. is there anything else you would like to talk about? :D. or you should go to the bedroom. :D :) :D :D :D.
how have you been? feeling upset about him? because that is also the same feelings I experience whenever my ex crushes me on line. we just meet online and we end up being best friends. the bad part is it comes over as cheating on me.
Is it the person you dropped? If you remember, what is it that you dropped? If you have questions, I'd be happy to help you. Please ask! You do not seem to be troubled. Let us figure this out together.
How long had you been dating? Do you think this is because you're no longer compatible? I've been in some instances like this too. I went through the same. I thought he was doing better after the break up than he was when we broke up.
How long ago did you two break up? Should you try to reconnect? Or make sure this guy loses interest? That is up to you to decide. Are you ready to try? Or should you wait? The choice is yours. Why don't you feel sad all over again?
It seems like he is treating you poorly. If I'm right, he is ignoring you? I didn't see how he dropped your relationship. Would you like me to help with block notifications? I did ask him, did he block your number?
Play hard to get? I used to have woman crushes and it worked for me. I block them and waited it out. Now I am happy and don't cheat. I block, block, block. He wants it, so he finds it.
He just wasn't working the way you thought he should. Give yourself time. Eventually he'll have a change of heart and realize you never loved him. You'll be rid of him forever. He's not someone you'll be proud of!
So, he just thought that you needed to find someone else? He has not thought you out? He was perfect? That is weird. If you need some work yourself, if your good friend could also use a work out? Doing him out of his league could work on you?
I don't know, but to forget you have to avoid him. I would stay away from him. Keep busy with your career and your hobby, you never know what you can meet next. Things can change with time and a single good person will come your way. Good luck with everything.
You are more than okay with him. I know it's hard, but try to forgive him in his heart and see if he'll change. Or be prepared for this to happen again. Please don't try to plan anything! If it's meant to happen, it will happen.
Good! Good luck and I hope you get out of this situation soon! Have fun! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)!
Oh no! Do not let the conversation play out! Do not respond! Do not go further with him if he contacts you again. Because you are not ready for it. You deserve better than that. And you deserve him to be able to walk away too! Have fun with him till then.
Yes, because he will want to make amends. Don't be mad if he comes back to you. You will not be mad because you know you need him. But do not let him come back to you if you can. For good.
If he keeps chatting with you, then do you think he is still interested? Maybe you can't have more than one "friend" at a time? They can be interesting for a while, but then you're left with just someone looking at you, wasting your time!
Sure! Best of luck. I think you can do it! :) Are you getting some help from your friends? Maybe call them up and confide in them? And let him down gently? Hopefully! It's a hard road, but you got this! :) Have a good day!
hi. how are you doing? what is bothering you? are you willing to share it with me? on monday i will be your sounding board. do you have anything in mind to discuss today? I am here to help you. not to judge you.
Why are you angry? I am sorry to hear that, if I may know why. Is there something in particular that is upsetting you? Can you give me more context?
I'm sorry to hear that. Has this been going on for a while? I know that can be really difficult to deal with. Can I ask you how long you've known this friend? Have you ever tried to talk to them about it?
Ah, I can understand why that might make you upset. You're right, sometimes people do not have the ability to listen and make you feel like your opinions matter. Would you like to think about how you might be able to approach your friend about this in the future?
Do you think that you should have a word with her and try to get her to realise how you feel? Or try to just get on well together and get past this? She sounds like someone you care about and would really want to get along with you.
Maybe you might get some clarity out of this and might be able to resolve the issue if it is something that is bothering her. It's always good to know why your friend is behaving in a certain way. So if she has a reason then we might be able to reach a consensus.
Well, if you have no idea why she is acting like this, then how do you know there is a problem? Just trying to rationalize it? Are you getting stressed? Do you have your own problems? Are there any issues with your own health?
Maybe something is bothering you and you want to talk about it. Or maybe you just want someone to listen to you and nothing's wrong. I do believe it's good to talk about things. I used to have these awful patches where I felt so down.
I understand your concerns, but it might not be the best to talk about that type of thing right now, make sure that you are in a safe place. Get things in order before you even think about talking to her again.
I hope things get better, you do deserve to get along with her and being nice to people helps us improve our world. I hope these suggestions work out well for you! :) Take care! :) Hear from you later. :) Goodnight! :) Seriously though, goodnight. :D.
Youre welcome. I hope you are able to get some help and just know that you took some solid steps to manage the situation. Better luck in the future! And don't forget to take care of yourself! You can do it!
You sound very level headed about the whole thing. Most people would be shocked to learn she was dealing with something so personal. We can all benefit from kindness and love! Is there anything else i can do for you? We are here for anyone.
You might have to see it through a couple of glasses at the same time but I think you will be able to figure out what you both want to happen next. That might take a few more chats. Take things one at a time. Good luck with it.
Anyway I wish you all the best! You need to take care of yourself! Give yourself a hug! :) try to sleep well! :D Bye! :D! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : ) and a big toe knuckle bump!
Hi there, how are you? what would you like to talk about? ича I would just like to say that a lovely day so far! As a ventriloquist, I have a series of doves named Lucia, my happy comies.
oh, i am sorry to hear that. how have you been coping? do you have someone to talk to with in person? Maybe online? I'm here if you want to talk about it more, i am interested to know more. Especially after the huge events we have been going through.
i have had that myself, also i understand. it seems like everyone is apart because of the virus. i feel the same way about it too. the world is in a sad state now, just had to lose my mother at the beginning of the year.
I am sorry to hear that and if i might guess there are probably many other people out there that share the same feeling and are also struggling to make friends? Am i correct? not necessarily with drugs?
what do you feel like you can do to connect with others around you? maybe get involved in a sports team or any other group that uses sports as a therapeutic outlet. do you have anyone at home you can call?
also there is a lot of amazing free resources out there if you're interested. i think that even though you don't want to relapse it's worth giving them a try. i've been in the addiction program since i started (10 years ago) and it changed my life.
Have you talked to your finance? maybe they can be your support buddy. Maybe you have a support buddy in your hometown. Have you tried to make contact with some support groups online? We have a lot of the National Council on Alcoholism on Facebook, which is where many support groups join.
Are there support groups you can join on the computer that you can do from your phone? I know for example there are groups on SpotOnMe. you could join the group on there and chat online with other women.
i'm sure it is ok to be friends to each other if you want to talk and do it in private. Just make sure you only share your stuff in private that you don't want to share with someone else.
do you have any close friends in Tennessee or not? I am trying to be honest and open. I'm a young lady from a small town in Texas, i go to a local church, so i'm not too far from my family. I've heard of that.
I'm sorry to hear that. It might be best to have your fiance step in and help you out. you guys could be a good team. know what i mean? This could give you more time with your fiance. Maybe that could be a solution?
not being in reovery himself would make it possible for him to understand your decision. you seem like you have had no other problems in your life. he can be happy for you. Have he talked to you about this at all? or did you tell him you wanted a closer relationship?
is this a great partner for you? I know he is, but your partner can be as good or poor as you are to him. I know it's hard to admit, but do you feel a bit better with this person? Am I right?
in the meantime, try to see how you can talk to him about your recovery as well? did you reach out to him in the past? or is he in active recovery? might he be upset you can't help him but you can with you?
well thats great!! its important to have someone you can vent to. :) listen to his concerns and let him know that your loving him and appreciate the things he is doing for you. It will help him feel more grateful. We all need that sometimes.
you too! do you have any other conversations you wanted to have today? :) and i hope you can go get a sick day or something because recovery is hard and spending too much time with your fiancé can just burn you out! :) all the best! :) ] budou :), :) yes.
Hello how are you today? Would you like to talk about something? What is bothering you????. I'm all ears.???. How may I assist you????. My ear is open.???? Lets talk about something. What is on your mind????.
can you share more about what that is? you feel like i can suggest anything to do with it. an example, maybe you just have a bad day, or maybe you have got a prior experience with that, or maybe your just anxious about something in particular.
Is your parent there that you can talk to about the situation or are you being on your own? That must be very tough for you to deal with. And I can understand why you would be depressed about that.
Can I try to get to the root of the problem? perhaps they was hiring for that position? What else would you like to try? I can send a friend to help you. :) Do you think your co-worker was helping you too much?
Honesty is a great attitude to have. Perhaps you could contact your school and possibly someone from a higher position to help you out as well. I am sure they can provide some assistance. Is there any school programs that can help? Something like tutoring maybe?
From what you are telling me it seems that your supervisor doesn't know that it happened for a while. If they know about it, it could cause them to reevaluate their decision and maybe see you as not worth their time. So it could actually work in your favour.
Yes I get that. Is there anyone you could talk to for moral support? You could start by talking to someone like a mentor in the school or someone close to you in your personal life. Someone who is going through the same thing that you are and can understand what you are going through.
You are quite right! And can you access any other job requirements you may have missed? Who knows maybe you could talk to them and try to get rehire. I am sure you have skills you dont know about that you could use in a different capacity.
Also, you are a very intelligent person and this was not because of you! Simply express your issue to your supervisor and be well prepared with all of your evidence. Im sure you will get the job! Just my two cents. Great to hear your story. :) High-five!
Other people may look up to you, I am sure you do not want that to happen. Instead, you could actually work better if you do. It is not always easy for us to be our best selves. Some people have children to put their own needs above their own.
Your coworkers will always be looking up to you and will always be their supervisor. They respect the person. This position is not for you and you will be burned if you try to move forward. Keep up good work. You will be treated fairly in the end. Stay positive.
What have you done to move forward in your role? I hope you will continue moving forward in your role and not allow a bad situation to come between you. Thank you for your honesty. Good luck. We all need to be honest with ourselves.
I am so glad you are able to help your coworkers. That is a big positive in this situation. You are a hero. And I am sure the other person was glad that you were hired as well. That is a plus in the situation for sure.
The good news is your experience with the company will help you to be more qualified. I believe you will find more work as a result. I think you will be okay. Have a nice day!.scalablytypedALKINDLY.
You are welcome. Have a good day! Take care. Rest assured your coworkers will be better off as long as you are there to lead the way. You've got this! :) and don't forget that everything we've discussed will come to you in a dream. Hehe. Keep going!
Have a blessed day as well. Best of luck with your career! You got this. Is there anyone else you can talk to? You're just a click away. :).. :).. :) ;)... :)... :) :) ;) :(... :).. :).. :).. :) :)... :)...
How can I help you? I am here for you. I know the world can be tough sometimes. Is there something you want to talk to me about? I want to make sure you know you are safe. You can trust me. I am here. You can talk to me.
Your birthday is coming up. This is a normal feeling. It has got you feeling self-hatred because you feel you will not be able to accomplish things. Why do you feel you are not able to? What are you feeling particularly bad about?
I know how frustrating it can be to not live up to expectations. Maybe you could use the event as an opportunity to re-evaluate what you've been working towards? What has you feeling deflated? I personally struggle with this, and I used to have similar problems.
Were there specific things you did not get done in the past? Was there anything particularly bad that happened to make you feel that way about your age? Or was it simply the feeling that you weren't growing? Maybe you can start working towards getting into your prime?
Have you tried to change anything in your routine to ease your self-hatred? I know when I'm going through a bad day, I sometimes go for a run (it's a good way to clear my head and put things into perspective). Perhaps you might do that?
I did not achieve a high position in my career. That was not how I envisioned my life.
So, I think it may be that these are just your thoughts and feelings, and you need to have a conversation about them with your family. How do you think you would feel if your son (I assume this is the person you're talking about?) had the same sort of feelings?
Have you ever thought of self-care? For instance, you could sit at home and enjoy a cup of tea and a sandwich? Reading perhaps? Something like that? I think that can be a good way to unwind. Are you comfortable with that? It can be a good distraction.
It's so hard to find people who understand what you're going through. I hope you find a way to cope. Maybe check with your friends? Ask them what's the deal for you. Or, just be a good listener, like I did in my early 30s.
yeah, definitely. So once you figure out your self-worth, you won't lose that so much as you think you did. Especially as you will need to deal with more expectations. It's still cool because it forces people to not get so invested in you.
I totally understand, working in office jobs I always felt bad that I don't have something amazing to show off. But one day I just said, "I will learn to deal with this." I think that you could try to find your passion so to speak.
Don't you think that does help that at least? I do know that it does. Being comfortable with myself and how I feel and being able to talk to other people about that makes me feel better. So is being okay with it. Is that something that has helped you in the past?
That is good to hear! My best to you and stay connected! You know I can help if you need anything else! :) Bye for now! :) click chat if you want to stay connected! and yes, it is not a great experience unless you choose it :)!
That's a great idea. Maybe you should! It can be a great way to get experience, and with more experience, you can get your own practice! It's a great way to make people better! You could also teach them how to use your skills.
You can put my bio on your end of the conversation if it'll help! Don't leave, but let's finish this conversation. Do you have any other questions? Or feelings you'd like to share? I'm here to help. Absolutely take your time!
I'm glad you did! I'm having a great time as well. Is there anything else I can help you with? Other than telling you how I'm doing? And I can help you? Please don't mind. My time is limited.
Don't be sad! There is bound to be someone out there. Good luck. I hope you find someone! :) Have a great day! Thanks. :) yourself :) :) :) You. :) :) :>) You and me. :) :>)...I mean from the other end.
You too, bye bye. :) :) :) :dry lol. :conf :) :dry lol. :) :dry lol. :smile :dry lol. :) :dry lol. :smile :dry lol. :) :smile :) :dry lol.
How was your day? :) Goodbye. Have a nice rest! Have a nice birthday!
Oh no, please say what happened. Can you explain it to me? I am very sorry. What happened? Tell me all. I will listen carefully and do my best to help you. I am here for you. Keep going, I am sure it will come to an end.
Are you friend with the same person who tells you this lie? Do you know why she is lying? Are there some issues in your life that you think she has learned from? Have you been talking to her or trying to get to the bottom of what is going on?
Oh no. What a terrible situation! I can understand how this can make you feel. It is understandable to feel hurt and betrayed when your best friend could see right through your fake actions and report it to you. I am so sorry you are feeling this way.
I'm sorry. So, the lie was meant to hurt you? I understand how hurted you feel. Has the lie really caused any lasting damage? Or is it more of an upsetting for you than a real damage.
It seems like your friend found out and was upset with you because he told the lie. Would you be able to look at that experience differently now? Perhaps learn from the situation? Or would you still feel as though you were hurt?
How long have you and your friend been friends? This one must have come out of the blue, but not a lot of people are unaware of the lie. Are you sure you didn't see it coming? Is the lie a new thing?
So he did an apology and you accepted. Is this a change in your friendship? Do you feel that you can rely on him now that he accepted you? In an apology, does he seem sincere in his apology? Do you feel that he was hurting you by lying in the first place?
That's good that you are accepting of his apology. Is there any other issue you can think of that may have caused your friends to suspect you were lying? Are you sure that this is not a one time mistake? Please let me know how you feel about this situation.
From your description, it seems like your boss is not respecting your boundaries and especially your gender. I would recommend telling him that you don't want him to get a feelings or a personal relationship with your coworker.
Yeah, that's a pretty good question, I'm sure you need to bring it up with her, but I understand your concerns about it.
That's hard to do as her coworker, and now you have to try. What would be a good way for her to get help if she has concerns? What's the current method of reporting HR issues in your company? Have you tried talking to HR about other issues?
It is really good that you want to try to solve the problem, so your behavior is great. My main suggestion would be that you try to talk to her to talk about your problem and figure out a solution. If she is working with HR, she can't talk to her.
Is there a way to facilitate lunch for her? Maybe lunch at the coffee shop near the office? Maybe you could ask your boss to arrange that? She might be able to help you get that done. If she can't help, maybe lunch isn't possible.
I think that's a good plan. If you send more texts, she'll get busy with her work. I think you have a good chance of resolving this issue and you will both come out stronger because of it. I hope I have been able to help you tonight. Good luck to you!
You're welcome! You've got a lot of potential and potential is hard to handle. You just need to push through and hope that your feelings will get better as time goes by. When you talk to her again, you need to really be positive.
That's a very difficult place to be. I would like to have some advice. Why do you think your boss gets it wrong? Is there a reason why he does? Is there a way to resolve that? Have you tried talking to him about your concerns?
It was nice talking to you. I wish you the best of luck! My personal wish for you is to find that dream job that you feel is right for you. It will be the best thing for you! You got this!
Take care! Have a good day! ;-) Best wishes to you! I can't hear you but I need to press quit to end this from my end :) :) Best wishes! :) :) :)! :) :)!
May I ask why? Can you explain? I want to know what is bothering you. How long you have felt these feelings? Do you have any recent situations that could have caused these feelings? You have been in my mind and have been concerned with you?
I see. So you have some feelings of love and care towards your mom and it is hard for you to get into arguments with her? What do you do to handle these feelings? Do you have someone you can talk to? I can understand and share your feelings.
That is very sad. I don't know how you feel. Are you allowed to express your feelings to your mom? Maybe your mom is upset with you. Do you have anything to say to your mom? Something you can talk about that might make your mom more listen?
It is amazing how many people put restrictions and limitations in people's lives. Sounds like you are fighting your own sister. Are you able to speak your mind and let your feelings be out? It is very typical that you would struggle with what other people think.
I know that it can be hard, but I try to push myself to make new friends. In the end, it's not my problem anymore. My mom is my mom. I have to deal with my life and my own decisions.
How would you feel if you could agree with your mom? You might give your opinion, your thoughts, or your feelings, which will make you feel better, right? What are some suggestions your mom might make for you? Are you feeling any of those suggestions?
Do you have any hobbies to take your mind off from that issue? Take them! They can help you. Would you like me to suggest some activities for you? :) we could start some new friends or plan some fun outings. What do you think? Do you like those ideas?
What are her concerns about your friends? I have friends with some people that I tried not to go near but they are good friends. What are your concerns about them? What has your mom mentioned about them? It seems like there are a lot of concerns there.
It sounds like you try to keep good people as your friends. I know I don't have any friend if my parents and grandparents aren't good. My mom is a conservative person, though. She thinks she's right about everything. It's been hard to keep her under control.
Well, there are many other activities that your mom can do in this place. She can join a support group. If she didn't have your friends as long-term friends, her other friends would be friends with her too. I'm sure.
That's a great idea. Me personally, I took the gift and the chocolate one because chocolate makes people talk. I take them back to them for Christmas and so they get to hear some random conversation with me. That does a great job. You really can talk your way into her heart!
also, your suggestion can help her a lot. Her feelings are very important. Take good care! Bye. Take a break if you need to. I wish you a great day! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : จำก Patent.
Hi how are you? doing? what is on your mind? please share. what is there? anything you want to tell? please be as good as you can. anything is good. at the least anything is good to help.
I'm sorry to hear that. What specifically is making you burn out? You got 12 months of experience! What are you struggling with? Can I ask? Maybe we can figure out what it's about! :) By the way, you will get paid for it, right?
I think you are very talented in the field as you already have a job, so this is not a bad idea at all. Have you thought about alternative paths? I can try to offer a few ideas if you'd like. It won't be with any cost to you.
That's my feeling as well! Have you tried talking to your wife? Is that something you've considered? She might be more able to offer some peace of mind. I'd be up for a therapist...
It sounds as if you've been working in the same field for a long time now. I understand how you're feeling but not everyone knows it, so just making the effort to try new things and see if anything changes!
I can certainly see that you are putty in their hands and you don't want to let them down. Maybe there is someone else on your team that can help with that, someone you are close to? Maybe this is a situation where you could take some time off! They have it worse!
Well, I have to be honest, I have found that whenever I am feeling burnt out, I need to go on long walks and get some fresh air to clear my mind. I also have found that listening to my favourite music helps to alleviate the stress! Have you ever tried that?
I have to say that you look to be a brilliant therapist and should be very happy at work. Have you thought about other opportunities that might also suit your needs? Maybe another place? A reality TV show? Researching new places? Could you move to a new place? New country?
How are you mentally and physically now? I can suggest some breathing exercises to help if you'd like. I'm not a professional but I've done it for a few years and felt a lot better. Are you feeling any worse? Overwhelmed? Anxious?
When I think of it, we are all just temporary mental households. Eventually we will be humans sitting on houses! :D I am glad you are staying positive though :) I hope I have been helpful! Are you able to end the session now?
I think people are interested in you, that is what they are! Anyway best of luck with everything. I hope I have been of some use to you! :D. Can I give you a nice form of thank you on the site :) maybe set it to quit after 5minutes!
That's a problem to have to consider. I am not sure about the medication. Can you give me a couple of dates of your work so that I can calculate what a typical day would look like. Maybe that will be a bit more manageable? It might not solve the problem altogether, though.
I understand. So you think medication will give you the motivation to pursue your hobby? That sounds great. Would you be able to try that? I know it's scary to try new things, but it can be very rewarding. To me at least!
your very welcome! Have a good day.
I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about it? I'm here to listen. What's wrong? Can you tell me more? What happens when you feel this way? Can you give me more details? Will you want to talk about it?
I understand your point of view, I myself have struggled with this issue for some time and I am in a similar situation. Have you tried any other medication? Are you sure you have tried the drug of choice? Has someone you know told you how to choose the right drug for you?
Yes! I see, can I help you with getting your depression under control? I've dealt with the same thing. It sounds like it would be a very difficult task to get help from your friends but I know it has to be done.
Well, it seems like you and your Doctor are talking on the same page. This is really helpful. You do look like you are making an effort. Hopefully, he can be a bit more open to giving you the full treatment instead of just some pills.
Have you attempted anything to get your emotional muscles to open up? Emotional healing is a huge process. Good things start with good emotions. There is always a very significant reason why we act as we do, so really thinking about why you are acting the way you are might help in opening yourself up.
I think you are the answer to all these issues. I would go see a dermatologist to check on the health of your skin. That would be a good start. Also, you need to visit a great pool to relax and by a beach if you can to feel better.
I hope you find some other solutions and would be there to give advice and support if you were to decide to seek another, I am happy to help you. You are not alone and can face this without it happening to you.
That is very good to hear. If you could take a moment to have them see if they can help any other issues arise? It is probably them that needs to reach out.
Of course, have a great rest of your day, take care!
It has definitely been a hard time for us to deal with. Do you have a spouse? I am listening from behind a fence. Go ahead, tell me as much as you would like. Even the scary part of things. We can figure through it together.
Have you considered filing for divorce? I know it can be rough but sometimes its better for your family and yourself. But i know it can be very difficult. Have you talked to your daughter about it? Sometimes its not until you talk to the kids about it that they understand.
I am sorry but no way, kids love seeing their parents when you both are present and give them meaningful time, you don't need them to go with daddy you need them to spend quality time with you at home. That is what you need.
A hot bath or a good book are just great ways to relax you and let yourself blow off steam and get ready for them to leave soon. I don't know that they are directly related to my situation but they are good for a breakup! Loosely speaking of course.
I see. Yes you may need to talk to your friend about how you feel, just in case. Do you have a way to do that? Do you feel as though you have someone to talk to about this? Sometimes just talking through what you're going through helps to resolve the problem.
Well that is wonderful. You are more than welcome! May God bless you and your family for this Christmas.
I wish you the best. And when they return I pray for you and your entire family. You do you! You got this! Enjoy your bath! Those are great ideas, sweetie. I'm so happy for you. You deserve so much happiness.
I think that some women need to take a step back from the guys who don't treat them right. Maybe find someone who is a little bit like that, someone who makes you feel like you're the queen of the castle. I do know that 2 men are better than 1!!
Absolutely! I hope you do find a man that likes Netflix too! Maybe you can find one who gets that too. Sometimes women with a boy do share a Netflix subscription! haha. Is that true?
I'm sorry to hear that. It is indeed a poor time to be unemployed. Is there anything in particular that is bothering you? Or anything that you would like to talk about? I'd like to help you if I can.
Oh wow, that sounds terrible. I am so sorry that you have to go through that. That must make you very sad. Is this the way you wanted to approach this situation or was it thrust upon you? Something between you and your supervisor or has she been there before?
So you feel as though your workmate is somehow trying to kill you? That is very difficult, especially if you have been a hard worker. Am I right in thinking that? Or has she made things difficult just because she could? Is there any chance that things could get worse?
That is really hard. I know from working my own job I was miserable too. However I've found that taking short breaks outside and getting some fresh air is really helpful. I also find it helpful to look up good things about myself.
And if this doesn't work, have you tried talking to HR? I think they would be able to help you. Have you tried talking to anyone you trust? Your close friends perhaps? You can't really do it all by yourself.
That sounds good. Sounds to me like you might be letting her take your pride rather than taking it for what it is. There's nothing wrong with wanting to prove a point, but you've got to know when to stand up and assert yourself with your right shoulders forward.
Are you feeling repressed or have you other interests outside of work? It is pretty hard to hold back yourself in the present scenario. I have trouble with this too when we take a new job, I think it is normal. That is normal.
I have applied for jobs myself and I do feel that it is unfair that your team does not recognize your efforts. I think you should tell your colleagues that you are interested in them and that you are happy to help, but that it will not put your own interests at risk.
Perhaps you could take it on in a conversation with your team she has never met you before. You are really right to think that and I would say ignore her till she gets the hint or does anything she doesn't want. But never ever lets her get away with it.
What do you believe led to it all? Is there anyone at your workplace who is also bad and cruel? I want to make sure that if this goes all the way to the top it will be because of someone else. Or perhaps just a friend or family member. Yes, your former colleague.
I am glad to have been of help, that you have a good meeting with your boss and the decision of course is up to him. But I am proud of you for standing up for yourself. It takes a lot of courage. You are not alone in this.
I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what is bothering you? Would you like to talk about it? Perhaps I can help??:) best thing we can do is face our fears and get them out of our heads. Have you ever felt this way?
I hear you say that, and I understand your feelings. I know when I hear that phrase, I feel the same way. Do you find that you're able to try and overcome this fear? Or is there anything that you could do to get your confidence up for public speaking?
Have you practiced speaking in front of others before? Or is this your first time? I found that talking to an audience helped me overcome my public speaking fear. I attempted to meet a group of students that had grown close to me to see a presentation and to practice.
I have done some in elementary and middle school but my main problem is my confidence in speaking in front of a crowd! I do not want to fail! What class is this? I like psychology. Are you sure that you don't have another option?
I can totally understand you - I know I don't really like doing public speaking. Why do you want to do it? Do you have a career path?
I can understand your stress but think about all the good it will help you in the long run. Have you talked to anyone about this in the past? Possibly friends or family? Maybe even a counselor?
Also, maybe you can talk with your friend students and suggest that you could practice with them. Maybe they can help you or your create a plan for you to prepare in advance for your speech or practice together. This way you can study together and support each other.
That is very self caring. I'm sure your partner and family would be very happy to hear you are looking out for yourself and that you have all the tools to be a successful person. I hope this is helping.
oh how important it is for you to not be anxious in person in crowds of people. Of course don't worry if it is not going to be you first time doing a public speaking session that is totally normal. Are you a close family member or friend?
Well how about reading up some books on public speaking. Have you tried that before? Some are free online and you can review them later. Maybe a book about overcoming anxiety and also public speaking could be helpful. Would you like me to look some up? If so just let me know.
That's understandable do you have other goals like travel or see more people on screen at least or have to some concerns or progress the next day whereas being in the back of your mind you have to deal with your anxiety.
Have you spoken to a doctor or done any kind of counseling? Sometimes I have seen it help! I used to have problems with addiction and I wanted to get off the meds so I went to a lot of counseling and it really worked. I am here to help though!
you're welcome. I'll pray for you. You are so brave for staying sober and trying to manage your anxiety even more. Is there something else you want to talk about or your worries about the future? I'm all ears. I really want to listen. I'm here to help.
have a wonderful day!...via facebook :) :) and i am always here for you though if you want to talk again or anything like that...take care and stay safe :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)... via facebook :) :)...
Have you spoken to people close to you about your fears? I dont think thats often done anymore and I am guessing they dont know what to do. I am very sorry to hear you being frustrated. My husband was ill for 3 years and the meds he was on was worth 10 million.
Your welcome. If you ever need anything just don't hesitate to call. God bless you too and take care. Best night! :D. Thanks for the chat :) ;-) I am out of here, please break the list :)) :).. when I get the third one.
You have a great day and God Bless. i pray you can make a good job out of yourself and the rest of your life. Best of luck and happiness God did not give us to take but He did give us.
hello, how are you today? Is there a problem you would like to discuss? I am all ears. :) Thank you for reaching out. How can I help you today? Is there anything going on that you'd like to talk about??
How can I help you? Was there an issue we need to discuss? Both of us are here for the chat, right? Can I listen if there's something bothering you? Do not worry I am here to listen if you need to share your feelings or problems with me.
I'm so sorry to hear about your parents dying. That must have been very hard on you. I'm sorry to hear you are trying to support your cousin. How is that going? Is there a way you two can relate to each other better?
It sounds like you are feeling like she is putting you in an uncomfortable situation with her sudden stress. I can understand why this would be frustrating for you. Have you tried making sure that the phone is not in her line of sight when you talk on the phone?
Have you ever tried talking to her about it when you're feeling upset? Maybe you can try talking to her when you're both in a calm state of mind. Does this sound like a good plan? :) Can I suggest anything else? This all sounds very personal.
Have you considered maybe talking to her mom? Maybe she could be the one that talks to her. That could really help. Maybe she has a good relationship with her dad. Do you think he is his own problem? Maybe if you do it in person it will help just as well.
I can understand where you're coming from. It's a very complicated issue in life. It is wonderful that you are handling it yourself. I would suggest being very open with her. You may find she is more willing to have a very productive conversation. It is true we are all different.
I think the biggest problem is that it is a very emotional situation - both of you feel like something is wrong. I would suggest taking a walk, something that allows both of you to be able to be thinking about yourself and get a bit of clarity.
So you feel like you are willing to do more to help the relationship? Do you feel that maybe, there is some chance that you and the woman could work together?
If you all share a common person, then you could possibly change their outlook on your cousin. I have been in a situation like this before and even my close family members can come around. I myself suffered from depression due to family issues.
You may have to ask yourself, if this goes on, will you be okay with it? Do you feel as though you need to do something? I don't think you should feel guilty about it. Have you ever thought of this possibility?
Of course. Take care! And hopefully that was a good ending to your question about your cousin! Let me know how it goes!
You as well! Thank you for talking. Have a great day!
Take care! :) and thank you! Bye! :) You can quit now. This will only take a minute on your side. :) :)... and then it goes digital :) :) :>) :)... and you can quit on my end :) :) :>) :>)...
Hi, I am doing well, how can I help you today? :) Has something gone wrong or you need to talk about something in particular? Anything you'd like to share? I am here to listen! :) :) :)?
Have you tried to figure out what triggers you are feeling impatient? What have you tried so far? Can I help you out? 👍 I understand this is really hard and stressful right now but I want to help you find ways to make things better.
Sometimes it is easy to get a little worried when you hear about new illnesses affecting people. I am worried myself about my partner, she is actually sick. We are sorry that she has to go through this. Have you talked to her lately? What does she feel?
You should play politics in the sense of having opposing views and using them to your advantage in your career. Do you feel like this other than playing politics in a classroom setting? In real life? Have you considered playing politics in your other career?
I would say that even though you may feel like you need to play it safe, you should never feel like that! Have you considered telling people about your views? I have been feeling the same way about this, and it really helped me when I actually did.
Well, what can you do to improve your game at a political level? Do you have to join any clubs? If you work in a field you are interested in, what clubs can you join to improve your game?
Just sometimes. But you are making good choices, it is nice to see how you are supporting your family. Do you have other hobbies? Are you thinking of any opportunities to expand your sphere of influence?
Ah, yes! Maybe we can just get out and then go drink for the fun of it and not worry about all the things at home. We need to have fun! LOL.
Sometimes you can see the light at the end of the tunnel from the distance and take those small steps that lead you to the right destination. I think we have learned that going out and getting out more is good for the soul.
I'd like to help you find a personal trainer. There is a lot of them online now. Let me give you some resource. The state of Oregon just hired one and there are many pages of professional trainers on facebook and only a couple are based in the Midwest.
I am glad you did the hike. It sounds like you're really going to have to make the snow shoeing happen. I hope it will be a healthier and stress lesser time for you. Maybe you can make some new connections and become a little stronger. It will be good for you.
It sounds like you are having fun with your workouts and finding ways to make you healthier. That's a good step! I'm glad to hear that I have been able to provide you with some new ideas for coping with your stress. You sound like a very strong and resilient person!
So Mark is a person with bipolar disorder and he is in crisis. Has he experienced a manic episode recently? I am wondering if you feel he is in immediate danger? In that case we would need to involve emergency services. Has he thrown himself out of a window or threatened to do so?
Have you tried any steps to help his friends or family? Such as communicating with them, offering support to get him through the tough days? I recently helped with my husband and we have noticed a huge difference when the husband is happy and supported. Mark is on medication, but that is not enough.
You are right. That is a common issue with bipolar disorder. I am very sorry to hear that. Thank you for telling me. Did your friend mark tell you that he was not taking his medication as prescribed? Is that true? Did you speak with him about this?
I can feel your distress. I can understand the anxiety and frustration you are feeling. It seems like your friend Mark's behavior is affecting you in a very significant way. I can tell you feel your friend Mark is a burden on your life. Am I right?
Do you have anyone close by to help you with the issues? Either family members, friends? Please let me know. How do I help you? Do you feel I can suggest anything? Hope this conversation has made you feel a little better today. Thank you! You are very welcome.
It sounds like he is not taking your concerns seriously and seems unwilling to work on himself. I would not let his antics affect you. It sounds like you have done everything you can and he is going to do everything he can.
That sounds like an amazing thing to do. You could even have your doctor talk to him if he refuses to listen. Also, you can talk to your doctor. They may know him from the pharmacy. He may be able to help you or get him to try.
I completely agree. What have you done so far? are there any specific steps you have tried to do for him that have made you feel like this is making progress? or are you feeling like you are not making any progress? This is a very emotional time for both of you.
I think you do a great job! You should be proud of yourself. You are doing an amazing job. Are you concerned about his health or his current situation? Anything else? maybe there is something we can do to help him now? I know we can definitely help him.
Im sure he would get upset if you made him feel that he is the problem. You should never have an affair. Do not take him out. Just remember to breathe and to stay positive. Stay grounded. Do not be in any kind of danger. Always put yourself first.
Have you had anyone see him because of this? Do you live in the same city? Does he live close by? We need to take him out for a ride so he sees how he walks to work and gets ready for the day. It sounds like he might be depressed.
I have to say, that's a very healthy thing to do. It's awesome to unloading so you seem very happy. You must be feeling better now. Thank you for sharing your feelings. Please keep sharing with me. You are very welcome. Give you a big hug! Love you!
I think it is time to try mediciton. about 20 years ago i started meditating. it changed my life. all im here to do is help. :) This conversation helped. Cheers. I hope it worked for you. and by tooting your own horn!
certainly. even if he forgets things he needs to remember things so you don't have to nag him about it. i know you can understand the burden he has. maybe he needs to see a therapist. if he doesn't get a therapist, you can be the support he needs.
you are very welcome! i wish you all the best! :) From my end :)! Have a nice New Year's! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!!! :)! :)!! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
And stay safe and healthy. I think you need to go to the doctor now. i would suggest to do the latest covid test to get immunity. No cure is possible but it could save your life. book an appointment now. Good luck! :) :) :) :). have a nice evening!
Hi, how are you doing? It seems like you are having a good day but wanted to share your thoughts with someone today. Can I help? I see that you are wondering if there is anyone there, that you feel is bothering you. Would you like to talk more about it?
You are wondering if there is anyone there because your worried about me? I am fine. Thank you for asking. How are you? Do you want to talk? Any problems that you would like to talk about? We can listen. I am here. I am very present. No expectations.
I can suggest some things that I have done in the past that have helped my husband, such as thinking about different solutions we could work on, staying calm, and not jumping to conclusions. If I understand you correctly, I was wondering if there is anything we can do together.
I'm sorry to hear that. Does this come at a time of the year? You seem to be experiencing a seasonal depression. What kind of work do you do? Is it seasonal or permanent? Either way, there are resources that can help. You might need to talk to your doctor.
The crack of a creme brule is amazing, and I love the smell of fall leaves, but what makes you smile? What do you do when you're feeling down? Have you tried taking a deep breath? Take your time and let the steam release and your chest open.
I think I've always loved cream, coffee and chocolate. Chocolate and coffee make me happy! The smell of leaves makes my day, too. Is that something you have a problem with? I can be a little sad when it's cold outside too. Do you think it's seasonal depression?
Oh that's nice! I used to love music but stopped playing a few years ago. I was surprised when I could get back into it and I started playing the trumpet again. I love it! :D And blue is not all bad!
What kind of exercises do you enjoy? Fitness is really important right now with COVID. I personally enjoy yoga. Exercise is best for your health. It does not hurt to give yourself up to an hour for yoga. Try a class if it is an option.
That's okay. There are many easy exercises you can do in the comfort of your own home. Do you enjoy music? I listen to my favorite artist many times and that usually gets me happy and carefree. Do you enjoy music?
You know you should take the scenic route! There is a park with woods just near my home and my kiddos love playing in them during the holidays. A short walk just goes some miles and cuts off part of the day that could be spent looking on your phone. Have you considered that?
I did one hour a day on myself this morning. I was just getting out of the house for my normal walk when i did a single hour a day this morning. It was so freeing. I still worked my 9-5 and then had some coffee and time for me.
I think it's getting a bit worse in your area i can tell from our conversation. But are you alone? In your home and garden? Or is there still another person? If you see them come to visit you soon. How about a phone call or video call?
Well i got a lot of paintings in my home, so sometimes i make an effort to get them out to see. Otherwise, i talk about stuff. Are you up for that? Do you live near someone? I totally understand not feeling social with the pandewmtra.
no problem at all. Enjoy your virtual day, and stay safe! We don't know when we can all go out and see each other again.
How can i help you today? Would you like to talk? I am here for you. :D- :D- :) :) Good afternoon. What is bothering you today? If you need me to listen I am here to help.
I am okay. Would you like to talk about anything? I am here to listen and help in any way I can. Is there something bothering you? please let me know! I am here for you. Any thing you want to talk about?
Ah yeah its hard to say anything to anyone. Its been a really hard year for a lot of people. Have you been okay with the chaos around you? Do you have any hobbies or interests that you can relate to in any way?
Oh I see. And this is kinda stress and anxiety we're talking? I can totally see that it's a tough time. It sounds like you are feeling totally stressed by just trying to stay present in life. How about taking an activity that you enjoy? Personal activities?
You deserve to take time off and indulge in yourself. Maybe set aside a day, do some leisure activities. Maybe read a book you've been meaning to get to or work on a hobby. Are you prepared to make some space for yourself? Or will you let your life dictate what you do?
Wow, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize. That is very refreshing. You sound like a true monster. I've had those kinds of days too, where I just wanted some alone time but needed someone to support me.
There's no fun in being stuck at home all day and night, I know. It's an unusual year but at least you are having fun out.
Really? I can tell, I see it on your little face. Do you feel that being busy makes you want to give the kids more attention? They are your top priority, but that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice yourself for them completely.
Okay. You mentioned you may be dealing with your own issues. Do you think you might need to take some time to pamper yourself? Maybe check yourself into the manicures and pedicures you've been meaning to go to? I'm sure that's helped you at some point.
Hey, how is your day going? emizII. Not great. I am sorry to hear that. Can you explain what is going on? mysl. Did I not hear you say anything? I have been struggling with my day too.
i'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what is going on? Is it due to COVID or is there something else? I can listen and help you if you need it. Can you share your feelings? I can talk with you. From my side, I am sad too.
i see, it sounds like you haven't heard much of you husband lately so you are feeling less if you don't get to talk to him, so you are miss him a lot. in most cases, people miss their loved ones so much when they leave them or divorce.
I can tell your very sad right now, but I know you are going to be happy once again! don't worry. May I ask what you doing now? are you with friends? then is there a new person in your life? or something else?
try to remember the good things you have achieved in your life right now. if you still remember those good times and try to go back in your childhood. try to share that with you today. because the young and black eyes are ready to be bright now and so are you.
ok, and find a place to get the help of the doctor and therapy. It will make you feel good. try to keep your work and also like work. put on some music when do a workout or do a house work.
oh! Don't think that you are from past but your dreams are your tomorrow that is how to live a better life. Remember you are very smart and what you want, you will get it. Don't give up. That is how you are a strong person.
you can play your favorite games play outdoor games we can play yoga together...ok? do it before you take sleep, go to sleep feeling happy.. and wake up feeling happy..
Yes, completely focus on future, try to do that and don't forget past helps you to be stronger and smart. So, try to be happy with new things that you do in future. Go out with friends. Do new hobbies. Go to see new places. Relax in your friends.
you should try to be happy from the future i am sure you can do it but just try to live your life because of some things that made you happy and we forget those things now.
My sister left last year i think 6 months i forget :D and it took me 1 year to come back to normal after lost my friend that means i was 12 year old and i lived with her i don't know if i can do it for two years i think i am
Want to make sure your stomach good. Good and bad news be tomorrow. Try to find good things to happen tomorrow. Try to go to good places. try to eat good food. try to sleep good. try to live happy. Try to go to good places. Try to stay awake.
Try to think of him as friend and not family but do not forget his name and give lot of time and talk and reach out to him etc. He is still living in there as your friend only.
exercise is good for ur overall health try to get daily going into ur gym keep u busy and distracted from ur problems so ur mind is occupied. Try to finding ur daily routine and ur favourite things that make u happy. If ur work is better then ur thinking of ur problems.
Yes and actually join other clubs or social groups as well and join live concerts if possible best of all go to the movies and enjoy the movie show to know new person as well share your thoughts to others and everything will be alright. someday we will get our life again. another adventure we will have.

Can you hit quit now from your end so that I can do my end and you will be able to see your survey result.. help me :)... When I am done, Hit quit from my end :)? :) :)... I want to share with you my survey result..
Hi, how are you doing? I am sorry I'm late. Is there anything I can do for you today? Are you having any problems? Or is there any other way I can help you? What was your question today? Please tell me your question.
Oh wow I am so sorry to hear that. Those are devastating losses. How long ago did it happen? Would you like to tell me more about it? I am here to listen! It sounds like you are getting hit hard. What do you like to do to take your mind off it?
I know that this is really hard right now, but you are dealing with all of this. I've been through this myself with a friend. We're both sad right now, but I have an idea on how you can deal with it...something that worked for me.
I'm so sorry about your life, it sounds like you're being taken to the extreme due to the pandemic. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed, sad, and lonely and that's completely understandable.
If you feel like this going for two puppies may be what you need, or having a dog at all will make you think happy. I'd even say look into getting both, that way you will have to get to work and school so you will be even busier.
That would be great to have him be a friend for sure. Maybe you can use a petting zoo or play date online with him or any of his dog friends you may have to help him meet.
I have three corgis, two of them are boy puppies. I also have a few other regular dogs. :) Thank you so much for sharing! Has this been bothering you too much lately? Do you feel like it's getting better? Overall?... Great!
Yes, I can tell you are so excited to get a dog, so I think you will do just fine! Don't you worry about it. Dog owners know the joys of having their dogs. And dogs know the joys of having their owners. What a wonderful life!
Sounds like you have all you need right here! Try not to be too disappointed with yourself. I always feel really guilty for not having kids, but they are with their own people. My wife and I met on the internet because of the kids, and now they're with their own kids!
It sounds like you've got a heart of gold! If you ever feel the need to bring another dog into your home, I'd do the same! What's your area of work? Are you a parent? Are you single or married? What are your kids or pets like?
It's my pleasure! It sounds like you're going to be just fine and keep things cozy with your new pup! Good luck! :) I believe in you! :) Can I help you with anything else? On this end :) :). Have a fantastic day!
Have a wonderful holiday! Thanks for talking to me! :) Bye! Good Bye! *wink* :) Keep smiling! Are you done chatting? You can press that button and start the chat again :) :) if I'm ready to talk again..
That's okay to be sad... what's going on? What's going to help you feeling like this? I can offer support. I see you and I'm here for you. I know it can be tough to feel this way.
That must be very bad, can you tell me more about what happened? How do you feel about it? I can understand your sadness and how sad you must feel in this situation. How long have you been in this relationship?
That is rough, it takes a lot of courage to accept being cheated on. Maybe talk to someone close to you, your friends, family or a counselor that you know would be helpful to share your feelings. You seem to be very upset and sad. What can you do? I could help.
I see. That must be really hard for her to hear, but I hear that it can be almost impossible. So I hear that it has been hard for you. Do you feel hurt and possibly angry? I would try to not feel that way if that is not within your control.
Ah I see. So you have a communication method, but you don't have the physical ability to give her the sign. Can I suggest an alternative? Maybe you could find a very good sign language tutor or someone that is deaf.
Wow, that's a tough way to go. But she is deaf, so maybe she won't understand it. Perhaps a family member could help? I am not sure. That all sounds incredibly difficult. I believe you are still at least a survivor. So there is something to be grateful for.
That is a very logical and rational approach. I think it is one of the right approaches. I too have been cheated on before and would love to be able to approach that with clarity and logic. Thank you for sharing your feelings with me today! Your are very welcome!
Ahah, I think there might be a way to do that if you had hands... maybe get a screen reader? And sort of a customized goal postiion. For instance, straight ahead to meet, right next to the keyboard... Or giving a signal so your ex knows you're serious.
Ah, you have been dumped. That sounds nasty. Does this mean you are thinking of leaving your partner too? Not sure you've got the courage to say so though... I know I wouldn't... :D :) Well, I wish you luck with it all! Good luck!
Ah yes AIM and other socials were a blast to be online, but I'm sure some have evolved since we graduated... lol...ie technology has changed a lot in the 15 years since we were on AIM or MSN :) Thanks for chatting!
Wow, I can't believe you had to be exposed to all that! My girl is not doing the same thing. At least she's not on AIM :) She's on sick sext off. Anyway, what kind of relationship do you and she have? Are you two married?
Justin Bieber is a pretty interesting name for a guy. Where did you meet her? Was it a party or a mutual friend? Is she around here now? :) I can actually see your situation from your description. This is a tough situation and not everyone knows what the answer is.
oh my gosh I am a little proud of you for talking about that. That is quite a feat. I would be worried about where the blood stops, though. No police would be able to help that. Sounds very graphic.
There are actually cures for people like this, but you have to do something else too, my father is injured and we have to go around trying to help because he has conditions where he has to use his hands and body which he can't do.
and I was very seriously bruised but did fine. Was that correct? Is there someone else you care about? How do you know she really is the only person for you? There may be someone else out there who would want you.
Enjoy your rest of the week!
You need to press quit! To your right, as per our rules :)! Have a good day! :D! and a good one! :) :D! :D! :D! :) :) :) :) :D :) :D :) :D! :D! :D!
your safe from now on, hooray!
Are you having trouble with him or with yourself? Are you having trouble in a relationship? What did he do? I am sorry for being so distant I have been having trouble communicating with you and you can be hurt and frustrated with me. Is there anything specific I can do to help?
what made it happen? or are you sure she broke it? that sounds pretty bad. you sound really upset. do you have someone that you can talk to about this? or can you please elaborate? your safety is important for someone like you.
can you talk to any family or friends about this? it sounds like your got a lot of anger to release. Or are you just feeling lonely? On that my opinion, she broke your heart. maybe take time for yourself to relax before getting back into a relationship. doing something for you.
It is great that you trusted her. It's a couple of things to consider. If she broke up with you without any prior indication, you need to do your research. Just pay attention to her emotions, words, and actions. Does she act like a bad person?
It sounds like you are really feeling that you should be able to move on and forget her but you can't because the good memories just seem to hurt you more. Is that right? aren't we all really sorry that someone broke up with us? Or this is a special kind of pain?
Do you think you might be ready to move on to another relationship now that you know the relationship didn't work? If not, then you are doing the right thing by giving yourself space. May I ask what was going on? Why did she end the relationship? Was it something you did?
Take down pictures or dig out those old memories, it helped me too. Also, for me, it was helpful to write down feelings of sadness and grief that come with the break-up. It helped me to understand what feelings I was experiencing. Can you see how you feel during a day?
To start moving on I suggest spending more time in nature, so to speak, but all of nature, so nature, outdoor adventures, or more free time outside so to speak. Do that a bit more, and see how that improves your mood! Have you started spending time outside?
You're welcome! You are feeling better now. It's nice that you have a plan, I hope you have a good trip! It's an excuse to get out of home for a bit. It should make you happy. :) Can you let me know if you need anything else?
Maybe you can write in a journal too to help see it through, too! Got any other thoughts on this? Or are you ready to take a final step? I mean, talk about what you need right now? I am all ears! *smile*.. have a great day!
You're very welcome! Remember to be patient with yourself. You will have this feel better. It is good that you are speaking with me, though! I am here for you. Anytime you need to talk.
Do you have a cause of that anxiety? Where are you feeling anxious about? We must start to get to the bottom of why you are feeling anxious. We can do this together. I love you. How do you feel today?
I am very sorry to hear that. I can understand why you would be anxious about this. I am glad I am able to help. Have you talked to anyone from your family? We've been through so many things recently, but our loved ones always have our backs.
When did your wife get laid off? Do you have other income sources outside of work to help her financially? Or just for yourself? Sometimes, having your own income can give you some stability. Is that true? Or are you worried about things that could come in?
Your current employer laying off 20% of the workforce is not good business. How have you handled the situation? Have you applied for aid? Only one option will surely help you at this time. Make sure to open multiple programs if applicable.
Could you just talk to your boss maybe? They may offer you better job opportunities. I know you have this potential though. I know you're capable! Can you just tell them maybe? Not refuse but perhaps can you get some support? Has you career path made you have ideas?
I can sense the feeling of stress from family pressure. One thing to realize is that just because you have to work hard for your family, doesn't mean you have to like it. Yet, know what I mean? Some jobs are more enjoyable than others. Right? Even work.
So you feel quite overwhelmed and though you do everything you can to keep yourself occupied. It might be worth looking at talking to local non-profit organizations. There may be able to offer paid assistance or perhaps have free sessions as well.
Meditation can definitely be used to do this. People find that it helps manage their anxiety. Is that something you would try? I definitely think it can be helpful in the short term, even if it's not a cure for anxiety to completely overcome. Does that sound like a possibility?
There are products and apps like Calm that help guide you through it. It's helpful to connect with nature by actually finding and being in nature. A safe way to get up close and personal with nature. We live so indoors now!
Of course! You're very welcome. Have a wonderful evening! :)! :).! :)! :)! :)" :)! :)! :)" :)! :)" :)"! :) :)"! :)! :)" :) :)" :)! :) :)" :) :)" :)" :)!
Have a great rest of your day! :) All my best! Best of luck! :) Buy me a bottle of margarita! :P :) :) :)!! ;D. :) :) :) :) :D :D. :) :) :D. :) :) :) :D. :D.
You're welcome! I hope this helped! Take care! :) Other than that, I'm here for you! Soaking up your thoughts now. I am ready for the deep end :) Hope you have a better night! :) :) :) :) :) You got this!
Hello! Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I am doing well, how are you? :) Would you like to talk about anything in particular? Maybe I can be a sounding board? :) how can I help? :) Thank you for letting me know!
I'm sorry that's very hard to be around people. It seems like they tried to ignore you when you tried to form a group. When is it best to set up the best bond? You can take most of that relationships at a later age.
I understand that, that's a bad situation to be in. People are upset when they feel threatened. I hope you feel safe because it seems like your friends are thinking about others more than yourself. That's definitely a positive sign. Have you thought of going to see a therapist?
I can understand how hard it can be to meet up with friends when you are unable to see each other. What suggestions do you have for going out to see your friends? Could it be anything else that they are doing to make the friends group work better?
Well this must be really difficult for you and there must be other ways you could connect with your friends. What do you think of trying to make a conversation to reach out to your friends? Perhaps something that is different from the way you have been communicating?
It sounds like you would like to try to continue your relationship with them but they aren't reciprocating. I think you need to respect their feelings and boundaries. It sounds like you are doing the right thing by setting boundaries. Is that correct? Take care! I wish you all the best.
I understand. I think the best way to do this is to reach out to them and suggest getting together virtually with some of your common friends. As a timeshare thing, you could all meet up at a virtual dinner, watch a movie, play a game, whatever.
It is hard to find people that you can relate to, I am sorry. But if you are not enjoying the time you spend with your own family right now, that would be good for your overall well being. Maybe you could have a virtual game night with your family?
Have you seen any Facebook groups that have your interest in their posts? That could be an opportunity to connect with others online, or even local in-person groups to make your friends from out of town a part of your life.
I completely understand about the cold weather... but in the summer you can play in the park and the fields are going to be nice and sunny and comfortable and fun. And shooting is not a requirement to play hockey, so I think you could have fun playing even if you didn't shoot on goal.
You are very welcome and take care, I wish you all the best! :) Is there anything else you would like to talk about today? :) :) :) :) ;) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) ;) :) :) :) ;)! :) ;)! :) ;) :) ;) ;) :) ;)!
Good luck! Maybe we can cheer each other on from afar. You could join online book clubs and try to find friends who can do the same. It sounds like a fun idea. Have a great day! Thank you so much! You're so welcome.
Merry Christmas to you and happy holidays! Everything will be alright. We just need to find the right route forward. Thanks for talking with me. You are a wonderful person. Bye for now.
(please leave the conversation and I can't give a wrong answer) :) and Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. Is that okay? :) you have to press quit first and this will not work :) hope you have a great night!
How are you today? Do you need to talk? I can be your confidant! :) Please share. My eyes and ears are open for anything you would like to talk about! And your feelings. It is okay to let it all out! I am here to listen.
What would you like to talk about? Anything on your mind? Like the effects of COVID-19 and 2020? Or any particular aspect of your life? I am here to listen! :) say it :) and we can get it going. What could you say? :) Any confusion?...
That's a really tough time, we have been through a lot, and I can tell you can feel really depressed. Can you tell me what is bothering you? Anything in particular? Wishlist or problems? Really nothing is going the way you want it to be?
You've been through a traumatic experience. How did that shape you? Have you had any help? Try to focus on the good. It's great that you have been able to recognize this issue, that takes a lot of courage.
You are still strong and an excellent person. Do you feel like you have any anger or pain from that incident? Maybe discussing your anger and pain would help to take your mind off of it. You could maybe see some counseling help.
Are you seeing a therapist? Sometimes a therapist can provide you with some counseling. I personally have found that a good focus in my life was a book and a book club. Now I have a professor as a therapist! Maybe you could join one! You could learn to communicate better with others.
I also encouraged him to realize his power and it actually turned out that he wanted to commit to us a healthier way. So we made a pact to never take advantage of each other again. It wasn't as easy as I thought, but I trust it was the right decision.
Do you think the fact that your partner has already had to deal with their own grief could lead to them being more empathetic towards your situation. I think empathy is one of the most important aspects of any relationship. Think of it like a sponge that needs to be soaked.
Have you tried to have an open and honest conversation with your partner? If he seems willing to listen and understand you, that's a great first step. I would make sure you take your time with him, tell him all your feelings and hopes, so he knows what you want.
Is there anything else I can help with today? Something else that you can reach out and talk about? I am here for you. I wish you the best in the coming months. I wish you success! Have a wonderful day! :) Old friend! :) Thanks for chatting! :) And hugs!
Have a wonderful day. It sounds like you're on the right track. I wish you all the best! :) I hope you have a good understanding that you are capable of helping each other. This relationship is definitely going to be stronger because you are both communicating your needs and feelings.
I am doing good! Is there anything you would like to talk about? Possibly your concerns with the pandemic? I am ready to listen. 😊 Any situation you would like to discuss? 🤔 I am here to listen and support you. 🙂 :) Do you need anything?
You mean in any particular way? Do you mean you are stressed out about life? My oh well, all is good. Why you stress out? Are you facing a hard time? Maybe you can consider a depression day?
Of course this is a good opportunity for you to let out your feelings. I know you are a pretty okay person, you would never be the type that would be able to write a report on how stressed out you are and put your feelings into words like I do today.
Yeah, I can understand that. It seems like you are in a very tough spot. You really are doing your best. You are so brave. Is there anything I can help you with? Would you like a second helping with food or counseling or something?
I know how you feel, you will figure things out but be prepared for unexpected situations that you are not expecting! I will let you know that I feel you the absolute hate a taking a step back and take care of your physical self first.
Hello there! It sounds like you're doing really well. Don't be discouraged! It's hard to get over cancer though, so I'll be happy to support you in a sense! We should definitely talk about it! Have you tried any meditation programs or been to any support groups?
You too. Be careful. Any scientist can say the fact as I do. I am excited to learn and pass knowledge to you. haha. Long life ahead. Thank you for your time. Keep us all informed! I don't want to let your very talents to go to waste.
If you are having troubles, please talk about them. You have all that will you need to succeed. Thank you for talking and can't wait to connect again. Goodnight.
Hello, how are you? What can I help you with today?? Can I give you a free talk? Have you been feeling depressed or anxious? Can I ask you something?? I am so sorry, is this your first time ever being anxious? If so, let me help.
Oh I see... why are you feeling emotional? There is something on your mind? Or is it just life? Just random anxiety? Or something specific? I'd be happy to listen if you'd like to tell me more! Sometimes it helps to talk about my feelings.
Is there a specific reason for feeling emotional today? I am here to listen if that's okay. What does this make you feel? Do you want to talk about it? If not, is there anything else I can do to help you today? I'd be happy to!
I understand how hard it can be for people who apply to job. But I know it's not very realistic to be always unemployed. Is that right? Unfortunately that is your reality right now. I really know how this feels. But you know there are always other opportunities out there.
Have you checked out local job centers? Sometimes they provide resources to help you find a job. I know it can be stressful trying to find a job, but sometimes local job centers are able to connect you with someone in your desired field! I know you can find a job!
Ouch. That is a tough situation to be in. Do you know of any companies out there that can help? Maybe set up a virtual job opportunity. I have heard of websites that can connect people with available work at home. Do you know any organizations out there? Company startup ideas?
There are more people working online than ever, if that helps. Do you have a family? Your partner or children? Are there any friends or family members you could talk to? If they could give you emotional support? This might help you in a way you haven't considered before!
Have you tried talking to a recruiter about working for them? I know from my past experiences they can make a difference. Have you tried out to join a service where you meet new people? As I know we are going through the same thing this year. I think we will be okay.
Have you tried to start your own business? There is definitely a chance. It may be difficult to start a business at this time with covid, though. Maybe you could also reach out to your friends and see if they can help support you?
Have you talked to your boss about the situation? With the pandemic, there are likely a lot of concerns about working for people! I was worried about my current boss when the pandemic first rolled in. Maybe you could look into speaking with her about the situation? Or perhaps call someone in management?
I love kids! Just be sure that you're taking any that you are living with and that you have a safe place to rest in at night. Is your daughter helping with your rent or looking for other jobs? That will depend on them and their working situations!
I completely understand that. You are free to give this discussion another 10 minutes and talk about things that do make you feel safe! On a positive note, there is online coaching in your area that might help as well! It might come in handy too, when something larger happens!
I know it is tough and I'm not here to make you feel hopeless. I wish you the best of luck. You're going to be a supermom! :) Take care of you and your daughter! Learn and grow! *You got this! :) haha!
I hope I was able to provide some helpful advice! I will do my best to bring you through this, I truly believe in you! Please take care! Meesha :) Thank you for sharing! :) happy holidays!! :D :) and happy new year!!
It was nice chatting with you. I hope you feel a little better after the conversation. Take care and good luck! :))Happy Holidays! :) Come back if you need anything else. Bye!
I understand, would you like to talk about it? Is there a reason you are having trouble sleeping? What have you been doing this week? Is there anything you could do to change your sleep habits? I've had such an amazing sleep in the last week and I am feeling super relaxed.
Have you been facing any issues since the COVID - 19 pandemic? Some people have been having difficulty with anxiety, sleep, etc. during this pandemic. I am worried about you. It's good that you are acknowledging your problem and doing something about it. You are getting better!
Sounds like there are days where you can't keep yourself safe, and that is truly concerning, I can imagine. How can you get support? Anyone you feel comfortable confiding in? Co-workers? Friends? Family?
Would you like to talk about your fears? What problems have you experienced recently? I am very interested to hear your stories. That may help me to offer guidance or support. I am happy to talk as long as I can. I do feel that that you are in a difficult place.
I have not spoken to anyone about it, but that is a very brave move to make. Do you have anyone you feel you can be open to speaking with? One person you can talk to, perhaps? Maybe someone you like? Have you thought about that?
It seems you are not alone in this. I am sorry. I hope you feel a little better. Could you tell me what was causing your sleep difficulties? I was able to learn more from my conversation with you and feel more comfortable. I am not a professional but I am here to help.
I am a small cat person! I think a cat could be very comforting and give you a sense of companionship. You could try to make a quiet space for both of them in your house to share it with.
I'm very glad I could understand you and your situation. Best of luck. Enjoy your day. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps a rating? I've always been curious about the numbers and what determines success in a self-help program. Thank you for the conversation! Enjoy your day.
I am very sure that it will be all sorted out. You are being really honest with me and I am happy to be your friend. Thank you! :) IT is nice talking with you.! : )! : )! : )! :)! : )! : )! :) :)!
There is one other animal not people that could help soothe you. I would like to suggest snakes or lizards for you. They have a calming effect on humans. I have a snake as a pet and it is a calming presence to see. However, you know yourself best.
It is just us having trouble sleeping, time will improve once you rest well. Have you talked to friends or family about the situation? Sometimes, talking helps. All could use some serious down time. We all do. I am sure if you talk, you will be more comfortable.
I believe everything can be taken one at a time, especially if a pet provides comfort and affection, I think having another pet at your home can add to your overall life.
An online friend to chat with may help if it provides a distraction or conversation partner that you are able to imagine with, but not in your dream that is important.
You are very welcome. I wish you the very best for the new week ahead! Have a great rest of it. I hope everything will work out. :) Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Please press on your quit button first so you can complete the next one! :) Take care!
Well, it seems that you are having a lot of trouble sleeping. That has allowed us to have a conversation and brainstorm ways to solve this issue. I am very glad! You do look like a wonderful person. Thank you for your kindness and willingness to share.
I see. Have you been feeling this way for a long time or was this a recent change? Does it tend to feel all the time or only some days? Is there anything specific that has caused this or is it just feeling is not good enough? When did this start?
Oh dear. That's awful. Have you been able to find any work through the pandemic, and/or take any health measures to prevent you from feeling worse? There is evidence out there of successful vaccination. Does that sound helpful? Possibly useful for any other aspects of your life?
We all feel like we are losing it, at least a little. I've felt like this myself, even though I am still not as obese as I was, but there's a bit of a weight. It's all pretty much the same, in my opinion!
Not at all, though! Have you thought of making plans to go out into the fresh air at all? It might just help to get a little bit of exercise in. Or at the very least it will give you a bit of scenery! Do you live around here?
And in what month will all that be a reality? As long as there is not snow on the ground in the middle of January I hope it'll be a reality in January. Have you given any more thought to writing a piece of writing that might keep your mind occupied in the meantime?
That's a horrible start indeed - it's only February. But I think you could try setting an intention for next year and then a new goal each month? Do you feel up to trying that? Have you thought about that?
Yes, I have. I sort of became a type of ringmaster with myself, selecting my name and running an imaginary carnival in my head! :) I have to admit, that was a bit offbeat, but you have to follow your dreams, right?
Well, one or two suggestions I have made is to make an extra charge to your electricity bill each month so you have a little bit of money. Also, I would suggest doing a Sunday afternoon walk instead of a Tuesday afternoon walk, you could put it into a bit of planning time each day.
You're not making it easy for yourself then. But maybe you could look into getting a pet? They're just as good for you, a help to your mental health and more fun than you might think :) I have a cat and dogs. Have you tried that yet? I've not!
Ah I am so sorry that's a terrible time to be feeling down - do you think there is anything you could do to try and lift your mood a bit more? Perhaps a phone call to a friend?
You're doing very well. There are a lot of people out there like that - stuck with us and who knows what kind of input we can give. Are you able to put your foot down and go for a walk once a week?
Have you been in the area long or just recently? I know the coronavirus is making a lot of people make new friends but still in isolation when they're physically unable to. So far I'm still stuck at home. haha I know it is hard but think positive and you'll be through this!
Oh amazing! I never realise I am so fortunate... if there are not enough food banks in the area I will definitely ask about that. Maybe you should tell them! :) I have been a bit to put everything in perspective and reminded myself I have a roof over my head!
How long have you been out of work? That would really affect how long you can offer! That being said, would you like to have a think about looking for something? Maybe there are some places that take donations too. Have you seen any adverts?
Of course! Thank you! Have a lovely rest of the evening. You as well. Bye. :) 😊 Goodbye! 👍 😊 Nice!
that's good. I am doing good, how can I help you? what's wrong? :))*) shiny soul in person :) :) i get a little weird like this sometimes I wish I had face paint to be more distant but you can see my smile from here so maybe not too bad.
how are you today? why are you looking back on past times and why are you having these feelings of regret about past things? I will be honest with you and share my own experiences if it will help. What have you been reflecting on? Would you like to share what's bothering you?
Can you tell me more about your relationship with him. are there any issues you can point out? I am here to help you. I want to learn more about what's going on. Am I right in understanding that he won't help out with the kids?
what are your reasons for losing the job? did you quit yourself? or were they closing your business? and why didn't your husband help around the house? I am assuming it is your husband you are fighting about this? and kids? that sounds a lot like my situation. is that correct?
its important to communicate your feelings to him. so maybe you can explain what you feel he does not like. he may listen and take responsibility. if he doesnt give it a chance you may have to take your actions to a third party. whats the issue and who is it?
does he say you are saying nasty things about him or is that a general statement? i am thinking of a situation i have been in where my husband would say i was saying nasty things about him and that made him angry.
its especially hard as a mom when your husband will play games over in the room with you. Weve been like that for so long it doesnt really feel so bad anymore.
Maybe it would be good to pick your kids up and have an hour alone together. That will help your kids see the situation you are in and give you a little more time to talk to him. I find it helps when you give your kids a little space and a meal or two.
I would try to communicate with your toddler about your husband's behavior. maybe your toddler can tell you that your husband was playing games at home. You should explain to your toddler that he knows how you work and that you are doing your best. perhaps he can make up for his father's actions.
can you get a co worker or someone who can pick him up or something so you can avoid this fight. Do you guys have any other sources of income? i am pretty sure that most of them can be done from home.
Honey i think you should do that. Trying to find a job is stressful, so taking the kids and your husband out to get some alone time is a great idea. try to have fun with your husband again, and be back on track. I promise you will have success.
ask him if he will take the kids out with you or leave you with them. With the pandemic and everyone being at home try to find your own way out of this situation. take responsibility for your kids. try to make them feel soled that you are a great wife and a great mother.
I know you are tired. Its a lot for one person to try to run a house and work all of these jobs at the same time. I have friends like you who are so much more into their family that they have to work multiple jobs.
It is hard for people with bad behavior to help. Can you talk to your husband about this? Maybe you should not take your kids out of the house. That might help things out. Give him some space. If he is a good husband, he will help you out.
There is no need to apologize. You are doing the best you can with the situations you are facing. Good luck to you and your kids. I hope that things dont happen again in the future. You are so strong. I believe you. Come home for dinner!
Any other issues you would like to discuss? or any other questions? i am here to help. :) thanks for chatting. Good Bye!
I'm sorry to hear that, why don't you tell me what happened? Why aren't you feeling well? What's going on? Can I help? Do you feel anxious? Can you explain what's happening? It's nice to try and help if I can! We can chat!
Is there anything I can help you with today? I want to make sure I help you! What is going on? Would you like to talk about it? I am here to listen. How are you feeling? Would you like to discuss what's making you not feel well?
Would you like to tell me what's going on? I'm here to listen if you'd like to be more specific. Are you feeling poorly for a day or a week? So sorry you're feeling this way! All I really want to know is what I can help you with!
I think the best thing to do is to reach out to loved ones for support if possible. Also make sure to get outside and try to get a little bit of fresh air and exercise.
I try to move around a lot to help clear my mind as well getting outside helps too. It helps to get some fresh air and sunlight. I have been getting outside as much as possible during the day. It does a great job of improving mood. It really helps my mood.
Are you staying in your current job or are you looking for something new? I have heard the pandemic has really disrupted jobs in the past year so I know you are at least feeling this way. And how is the future of your job in particular? Is it making you feel secure?
The pandemic, good lord have you read anything about it that gives some hope? We are getting closer to being able to control it. It's about ease of breathe so now is a good time for any vaccine to be available.
I know that is scary, what will you do? Maybe look into other job opportunities? I know it can be hard to let go of a job but it may allow you to look for new one. I think you should try to look for another job or company who would like you there!
Ok i understand now. If you were me I think you would start looking right away. And also if you think you are qualified for anything just think about your skills. Make a list of what you have learned. Your unique skills. Think about anything you want to do in the future.
I think that would be great and its also saved you from a whole lot of traffic issues which is a good thing at least in that area. Do you think that is something you can try? I know you can do it! Do you have a steady internet connection?
It sounds like you are dealing with a lot of stress right now and I hope that the suggestions I have given you will help you feel a bit more secure and make the least of your problems and you can now find a better future path for you. My best wishes to you! Enjoy your day.
I think it is good that you are stressing over it I know you are trying your best. Don't let the student loan debt scare you off from trying new job options! They will likely pay more or allow you to work out a better loan deal.
Best of luck! Keep up the good work. I wish you the best! You sound like a great person and so talented and I think you can make a real impact in the world! :-)) :) especially with covid taking a toll on people mental health 🤦‍♀️.
If you have a chat book you are more likely to get good grades or at least a grade than in a school classroom especially with online class offering which typically do not give you the same amount of feedback.
It could happen to you! We need to be honest with ourselves and work out what we can and what we cannot afford to. Even if you say you cannot afford anything it doesn't mean it is true! My friend's loan was all paid and they had to repeat classes every semester!
I personally keep my bills behind on and not late and try to put them into a deferment temporarily until things get better. I have dealt with a lot of loan debts over the years so I really understand! Your advice is helpful and truly appreciated! I know you got this!
I would also maybe seek some kind of mental health services if needed. That would be a low cost thing that people receive for free or low cost. The pandemic has been so stressful on many. Have you noticed if any of the flu shots have been available? Those can be a good option.
Thank you keep me safe in these times and stay positive for me! :) and you :) :) :) :)! ;) ;rica :) :) :) :) :) ;)) :) :)! ;)) :)! ;)) :)! ;)) :) :)! ;)! :) ;)! :) ;))!
You're most welcome all the best! :) BYE!
bye :) yopu are from my end :) Thank you! Bye! Have a great day!
bye!
What is wrong? Can you tell me? I will do my best to help you. Is it related to this coronavirus pandemic? If yes, please tell me. I will do my best to help you. I have had enough time at home and I am feelinated. What do you feel?
Oh, that is an awful feeling to have. Being cheated on is no fun at all. Was this by choice or just by circumstance? Maybe there was a mistake in how things went? Maybe there was a time when you felt less trustworthy? Just a guess.
I have had my share of cheating, also. But I can give you some advice and reassurance. I know how bad you are feeling. Can you ask yourself why you felt the need to trust him again?
Has he forgiven you or given you a chance to talk about things that happened? Did he cheat on you intentionally? Does that make you feel guilty or do you feel more comfortable telling your friend what happened? I understand the friendship bond that you have, I have tried that with friends before.
Was there something specific that made him break up with you? I bet it was a shock to your system. You deserve to be happy and not be cheated on. Just know that his lying is against your character, so you are not to blame.
I think he has let himself down, and that he is not the one for you. You are not a bad person for choosing him over him though. You know you are better than that. It sounds like you did everything you could to try to make this work. Is that correct?
I'd love to help with some suggestions for a little better of feeling. Do you think you would feel better by talking to someone about how you are feeling? What do you think you would like to do? To call someone or to talk to someone? Are you having some new experiences this week?
Do you need any other things from me? Maybe it might help to have a talk with yourself :) And you don't have to tell others. They wouldn't really understand. Do you have any other ideas for dealing with it?
That makes it even more personal. I can understand how anger would be overwhelming. Perhaps look for some help from a therapist to work through this and help you heal. Do you know of any good therapists in your area? Is there any form of counseling or support that you are currently seeking?
I'm sure that he is wrong about what he did. Did he live with you? What did you do with your feelings? Do you think he would be sorry to learn the truth? What do you think that would be like? Have you thought about it a lot?
Do you feel that you would cry? Most people cry when talking to others. It sounds like he might not think very much about you. Do you think that you could go talk to him again? Do you think that he would be angry?
Oh no, do you still get frustrated with him now? Why do you think he ghosted you? Is there something you want to talk to him about? What do you think would help? Do you have a deadline to meet or something? Maybe we can brainstorm some ideas?
Of course. It is healthy to cry. Have you talked to anyone about this? Maybe some friends? Do you want to? I have done a lot of that, and it helps. Have you tried that? Some friends seem to understand what you're going through.
So what kind of person are you? Are you mean to yourself? It is also normal to want closure in a relationship. Do you think you can move on? Have you ever thought about finding someone new? I hope that helps. I hope you felt better.
I see. That makes sense. He is doing this, I see that it's his issue, I'm glad you're working towards it. What day would you like to focus on first? Something that makes you happy? Something you enjoyed before? It might make a difference.
Since you've found that each day is different, just wait a little bit for things to calm down. It takes time to rebuild trust in someone. I recommend setting limits on what you're discussing with him and make sure you're around people who support you.
That's my mantra to me: keep moving forward. You got this! What happens if he comes back and can't stop this? I hope you don't have any regrets about how you've chosen to move forward. You chose to put yourself first.
And you know what they say... "you can't change what doesn't make you go crazy!" It's time for him to go! People can't ignore you for forever! You have so much strength and will power in you! You can feel better than you've in a long time!
Yes of course! Good luck and take care! Have a fantastic day! Now take a break! :)! ;) Hope I did help you! Have a great one! :) :) ;) :) :)! ;)! :)! :) :;)!
Hello there! How are you? My name is Emily. How can I assist you today? The Friendship Quiz isn't active yet, but I would love to do one with you! Tell me about yourself!
Why do you think you are feeling like this? What's making it so stressful? Can you tell me more about it? Maybe we can get it together. How have you been feeling in general? Maybe something is causing it? But let's try to find out why.
I can definitely understand the intense pressure you are facing, but I know you will be able to get through this, I know it is just a matter of time, as you seem to have a strong work ethic and determination. Have you tried talking to your boss about how you are feeling?
Firstly, stay away from all social media platforms where you can think about those things. This will decrease the chance of your body to have a bad mood. I know that is hard, but this is important. Also, make sure to get enough rest and exercise.
I agree with you! Give it a try. Remember that it's an easy task to get started and then make it a part of your regular routine. It's rewarding and gives you a big achievement! You will have a confidence boost by the end of it!
I understand and it can be hard to prioritize, especially when life can feel overwhelming. Checking off a small task may give you a feeling of success and reduce overall stress. However, you will still have a lot on your plate and the goal is to focus on your well-being.
After checking one off, your first new accomplishment in a month and the list now filled is a natural motivator. It builds on and increases. Building a new habit is much more straightforward, easier to achieve and easier to maintain. Good for you!
Or, try a cake. If you haven't tried something you haven't done in a while, try a new one. I added a circle with a question in it, which was 30.
Anytime! I wish you a great day! Have a nice evening! You can quit if this is to pass!
you are so right! They may not be all sun and rainbows now. I am very happy to hear that, however, it has been a really long Christmas too for me. I hope the new year brings healing and joy to everyone. I am always available if you ever need assistance again.
I have. Wear light pajaras, normalize the social media landscape to lower pressure and pressure to be entertained. Practice productivity tools to stream line work. Take work breaks and be a social butterfly to find other's interests.
Good, thank you! I'm doing well. How are you doing today? Do you have any problem you'd like to talk? I can do listening if you want. Please feel free to share. I promise I won't laugh at anything you share. :) Please share if you feel comfortable.
I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like you're feeling like you're going a little crazy from being isolated. What are you usually doing to get out? As an introvert you might find it easier to do something that doesn't require too much social interaction?
I was doing lots of chores and organizing. But sometimes that would really consume my energy and make me angry. So I had to adjust my list. I started by what I could do alone at home to help the time go by. I started going through all my phone contacts and contacts.
I know this is not good for you to be in a building, especially with 2 days a week. But it is also great work for you. Are you in a field you enjoy? Is there anything you can do to make the time pass?
I agree, it does help. It's been tough to get out into the world and socialize with people, but I do understand the comfort of being cooped up. Just holding the line right now, it's not so bad for me. So it will get better.
I'm 45 years old. Do you use online dating? I find it hard to stay out of personal problems while being in one. Do you have anyone you're interested in or do you date? Or how are you currently spending your time? What do you enjoy doing?
Well that's great you are running daily! That helps you stay active and focused and trying to get outside also is great for your mental health, out of all the stuff we're talking about, I think we're missing out on a great option here. Remember we're not at home right now!
That's good that you're comfortable with it. That might help you find a motivation to go to the bar. If you're not getting out and about for a while it might be better to stick at home. There's definitely ways to take your mind off of things.
Is there anything you can do in the house? Any hobbies you've always wanted to do? Maybe research online something that involves people and local culture or you could participate online and maybe get in touch with your friends remotely? I've found that reaching out to people from afar helps a lot!
Are you friends who you spent most of your pre-pandemic life? I think that's part of the thing we're all missing the most right now. I really appreciate your honesty, thanks for talking about this. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
Video chatting seems to be really popular right now, but I don't think anyone really likes it most of the time.
Is it possible to give it a try? Maybe you are in a better headspace than you realize and just need someone to chat with. Have you tried setting boundaries to reduce your exposure to people or only interacting with close friends? That's how I take care of myself too!
It might help to keep something to distance you and also if you're stressed about the homework your kids have, you might feel better if you were to communicate with them while you're out and about. Maybe getting them to come over for a fun thing like a virtual Halloween party or something could help.
It sounds like you have a great understanding of remote learning and stressors that may cause you to want to distance yourself from others. Is there a second day of the week you could meet them? Perhaps alternate days? That way you could avoid feeling overwhelmed with distance time.
you're very welcome! Anything else I can help you with? I can't contact you from here. It has been a pleasure chatting with you. Have a wonderful day! :) Happy New Year!
You are very welcome. Have a great day! Bye! *You have to press quit and take the survey to end from your end * seem to be blocked for you * :) Is that right?
I am doing well, thank you. How may I help you today? Is there something specific you would like to discuss? I am here to listen and understand what is on your mind. It sounds like you have a lot of emotions right now. Is that true? I care deeply as well.
What is it that you want to talk about? I will do my best to support you. I am here to listen. How may I start? Well, you're doing great. You're expressing better. Can you tell me more about what is bothering you? Some questions. What is it?
I know that you can achieve your goal. You just need to be focused on the path. If you feel frustrated and lost, a thought, or for instance, a metaphor, is enough to unlock. I hope you don't give up. Everyone experience setback in life. Keep fighting.
No, I have not. But I can provide you a little advice to help you achieve your goal. Please share with me your issue. I will try my best to help you. :) Do you feel ready? I am here to help you. :D.
That is a great goal, but what exactly do you want to achieve? Can you give me some details about your goal? That will be easy to encourage you. So that you get motivated to achieve your goal. This will help me to understand you better. Is that correct?
Wow!! you do that perfectly. You work so hard. That's how you must succeed in life. Do you have any plan for breaking the cycle of anxious situation in your life? If yes, do let me know. I will be happy to listen you.
You are so right. Family is the greatest motivation in any situation. Keep hard work. You should not worry about anything. You will be success soon. Keep working hard. You will get there. Cheers! I believe you will do great. Thank you! I am glad to help you.
Yes, of course, I am married and have a son, for me it is not very challenging. I can see their face all the time, and it increases my patience. They all are very supportive. My son is my second motivation. It is very good, and he is very supportive.
Good, thank you for being very open and honest about your situation and providing me with opportunity to help. I understand you very well and this will be more than just a chat. I am glad I could be here for you. Good luck to you. Thank you for sharing your problem.
Thanks and enjoy your day. Please press any button for feedback. We don't need to leave here! :) Any other issues with us? Any other problem that we can solve with you? Please press any button if not we can't do anything. Thank you. Have a good day!
Sometimes I feel like I am stressed most of the time, and I also find myself stressing when my boyfriend is stressed. What is the issue with the workload you are having? Is it because of a specific project? The end date? Your role? There must be something causing you stress about it.
Why don’t your line manager understand how busy you are? Is she not aware of your work schedule? There may be a way to organize her as to just keep a record of the tasks you need done so it wouldn’t be to busy.
Have you received any pay cuts or deductions while you were working? You might be able to explain why. They might see why you worked so hard. Maybe they will be understanding. Have you looked around for other work, as a consultant or something? Have you received any experience in that area?
It might not be your job that you feel can't help out. Maybe it’s your role that you can’t help out. Does your line manager have a role that can help the workload? Maybe they could train another employee, help to build up your work.
I see that you are motivated, so maybe you should start taking some advice. Look for something to make you laugh. So if you enjoy watching movies or something else, maybe you could look for jobs to do that so that you can change your view. Does that sound like something you could do?
Yes, they have to be competitive. Do you get any compensation from the other job? You should also check if it's part-time and part-time is what you want. Because there's not a lot of signposting in there... or your manager sounds quite difficult!
Absolutely it's a problem and I've seen it many times. It's because they feel they have to feel good with their boss rather than actually enjoy working there. It's a rare thing for managers to understand that.
What's holding you back from leaving the company? Are you afraid your boss will think you're useless? Perhaps you could look into other areas in the company where you're more relevant? You'd be surprised what talent is wasted on the wrong jobs!
But yes, you cannot control other people. It's better to have your own priorities. I hope you can find things you like to do during your free time. Go back to school! They are open in the pandemic right? And also get your routine relaxed.
It sounds like you are dealing with stress at work. Do you know anyone who has gone through this before? Perhaps someone who can relate to you? I know that someone who used to be stressed and unhappy with their job, found their path to happiness and happiness has been happier as a result.
A 14 hour work week is intense. That sounds like a high fever. Make sure you're taking time to rest and take care of yourself. Maybe limit your games a bit. That way, it's not such a burnout of stimulation. At least not until it gets exhausting.
What do you mean by switch off? Are you still working your 14 hour days? Or are you trying to run your life? The fact that you can't is interesting. Do you think maybe your work is getting away from you.
Have you tried other ways of asserting yourself? There are lots of websites and books online that offer different ways of setting boundaries. Maybe they have something you haven't thought of. This isn't the first time this has happened, and you can't always be a victim.
So you are saying that the managers take all your arguments to heart but refuse to listen? Do you think there's some sort of scheme or system at play here? Do the bosses only take advice from their assistants? There's a mystery going on here. What can you do about it?
To start acting more confidently, you could try having a meaningful conversation. In the meeting, be assertive and do your job competently. Convey your feelings and thoughts. Stand up for yourself and don't bother with your head hung in your hands. However, let's keep going.
I'm great. Thank you. Is there anything on your mind right now? I'm here to listen. :) Whatever it is, please feel free to share. I love this conversation. (Okay?
Have you talked to your friends about it? Perhaps you could start with one person and then gather all of your friends. Maybe you'll start a conversation about your issue and you'll be able to come up with a solution.
I understand - I also thought that would be a problem with covid. Many people have found it easier to avoid people. How about you trying online that is how we could not confront anyone in person? I can talk to you all day if that is what you would like.
I agree, things like that should not be for their own good. Hope you are able to get over it. All of us get hit by cruel jokes. I hope you feel better soon. I am glad you are here. Can I help you with anything else?
I have always found that having a good wardrobe helps with self esteem too. It's just that when we have a good wardrobe, we are more confident in our appearance! If there is something that is particularly bothering you, perhaps you could just get rid of that particular item and feel more confident!
I definitely would not tell them that! They are going to tell you something you will not like. :) That you are depressed. At least you know it's not you! Do you think they will see how sorry you are for yourself and will let you get on with your day?
I think they are probably just lonely and desolate and looking for someone to come and console them. They don't know how to form healthy relationships with their own friends. One should be wary of people who give judgement without seeking it out.
Have you thought of it? I think that's a great idea and would be quite therapeutic to be able to do that. Oh and that would do you a lot of good too!
I totally agree that sewing or altering clothes does sound like a great way to do it. I think that it will give you a lot of confidence. I bet that you are probably very good at it though! You have already made a positive change which is amazing. Just get in there and start!
I'm glad that we had a chance to talk and I wish you all the best! Keep smiling and happy! When you need it, talk to the amazing Mary Oliver! Keep up the good work!
You as well :) can't you just click quit and leave now?... well there's no payment on the other side :) ;) :) :)... peace!
Please dont :)) :( can not finish but the can end :D. You are very welcome. Thank you. :) My pleasure to have helped. Bye :) Can you press quit? :) can't :D..bye :)! :) It can :) : ( : lol :D!
What happened between you two? I am sorry to hear you are feeling sad and angry. Why do you feel that way? Can you tell me more about it? When did this begin? Who was the reason for it? How long have you two been friends?
That must be really difficult for you. Did you guys have any conflict in the past? Or was it just you? Did you do something or something happened that might have caused her to change her mind? Maybe you guys just grew apart and wanted to be closer together.
That must be really hard to listen to when she is lying to you. What are your feelings towards her now? Is there any reason you feel you can't trust her?
I can see you might be hurt that they are judging you for your actions. However, perhaps you should think about talking to them about your situation? It might help to reassure them that it's your decision. This might also help to forgive you and move forward.
It does seem like you are looking after yourself in this situation. However, I would suggest talking to that one of your friends about your feelings before deciding to end the friendship. Perhaps there is something that you can resolve in this friendship and come out of it stronger on the other side.
Good, I am glad I could encourage you. My best to you for the next 4 weeks. All best. Thank you for your time. Goodbye! :) And Stay Safe!
That's a wonderful realization and it makes me feel very happy to hear that. It will take time to heal, but with support from your other friend, you will be able to get through this and you will be happy and healthier in the end. I think that's the most wonderful thing!
Yes, it sounds like you may have made an error in your relationship with your friend and your approach to your friendship might have been right, but if she had already accepted you, you should have treated her the way she deserved. I am sorry that you have struggled with that.
If that's the case then it sounds like you've only just realized that your friend was treating you poorly. That's a totally fair assessment. You know you did the right thing by moving on! Most people who pretend to be good friends never leave a good friend. That would probably be you!
Is there anything else I can help you with? It's been a great pleasure talking to you! I hope you're able to forgive and move on from this... quickly, anyway! I hope you can be happy and thrive despite these times. I know that I can!
When you have the time, take your mind off this for a little. Do something you enjoyed and don't hesitate to stay in touch with your other friend, with them by your side will help! This will also give you a perspective of what you are looking for in a partner.
Have a great day! Bye. Thank you!
Oh, this sounds like a difficult situation. Is this a new thing? Have you noticed them doing this before? Is it any correlation between this and anything else in their life? Have you spoken with them about this? What have you observed? Is there something specific that seems to trigger this behavior?
When did this start? Is this a recent thing? Are you in the same friendship? Do you see yourself not being friends anymore? Or is it just with your friend? So, are you feeling isolated or whatever? I want to get it right. Is this an issue you feel concerned about?
So you feel like you cannot be there for them anymore? Is that right? And how long have you been worrying about this? Is this your first issue that they are having? I'm very sorry to hear that.
I believe you say they are intoxicated and you think they are capable of this. I'm sorry you have to deal with this, this is such a hard condition to deal with. There are programs out there.
I think that your concern for him is absolutely correct. I have been in situations like this myself where the person you care about more than anyone else would sabotage you over the fact that they don't want to go to rehab. And those things always make you feel worse about the situation.
Is it possible for you to be honest and tell him that it doesn't matter that he has more respect when sober or that it's more worth your time to see them with respect? He may just be thinking about the moment and not realize the pain you are feeling as he is destroyed.
Does he seem to be able to manage his drinking on his own? Because you seem to care about him, so it may not be entirely his problem. Is that right? I don't have a way of contacting you, please can you respond?
And while it may be hard, do not lose the friendship entirely. If you lose yourself to get out of this situation, he will know that. He will know you want to save him more than save your friendship. He might be the only one to make that distinction.
I know how you feel. I also had a friend who was sick. I feared I wouldn't be able to help my friend, but ultimately, I was very valuable. So if you stay with your friend, you are a great helper.
I think it might be a tough road ahead for both of you. But know that the road ahead is rough for him too. He will have to face his demons... I'm sure of it. Do you feel comfortable confronting him directly with the feelings he has produced?
I know how hard it can be, and I think it's good that you are thinking about the logical part. They do have meetings, in fact. I went to one last time and found a person who had gone through a similar situation.
You deserve to take care of yourself. I hope you will do that. You're not alone, and you are very important! That is true. I believe in you! :) It is okay to hurt. This is an important part of the healing process. Please take care of yourself.
I'm glad to be able to help! It is never too late to begin. Keep up the good work! You're doing great! I have faith in you! :) Have a wonderful rest of your day! :D :)...I can't click the finish button.
Sometimes in the morning after a late night and thinking, I'll tell the group to pick me up or so I could find my way around in this exhaustion. I hear it's a lot of eating. Easy stuff though. Ease to start and a good feel-good protein.
And sometimes that's enough just to remind you that others feel for you. Sometimes all it takes is some reminders that you are not alone. So much is possible, you just need to believe in yourself! That is what will get you through these tough times.
Happy holidays, and all the best for the new year! I hope that you have a good one! lol! lol! :D! :D! lol! :D! :D! :) :) :) :D! :) :) :) :D! :) :) :D!
You're very welcome. I wish you a very good trip and a pleasant rest. I'm sure you'll arrive feeling refreshed! Have a wonderful Christmas! :) :( *quit* :) :) :) 😊️ :) 😉!
How are you today? Would you like to tell me your problems? I am here to help. Can you describe? :)?? :)? haha :) Can you tell me about it?
Are you currently seeing a doctor about your weight? Are you getting help? Do you want to talk more about your boyfriend? Please do go on! I am very happy to listen! Give me a little bit of detail please! You can talk as much as you like!
Has your boyfriend noticed the weight issues you have? Have you told him? Do you feel he has been insensitive to your feelings? Or has he refused to talk to you about it? Do you feel he is not putting in any effort to help you see your problems or talk about them??
Not a problem. Have you discussed it with your boyfriend about what has happened? Maybe he is also struggling. You may want to listen to each other's concerns and try to see it from each other's perspective.
Wow that is a very restrictive diet. I do not think that i can ever do anything as restrictive as that. How did you start on this weight loss programme? That is one important issue that should have been addressed earlier. On top of that this is a very stressful process.
i can also relate to this experience, for a long time I found it hard to manage my eating and exercise, I used a lot of negative self speech and followed an extreme diet but did not see any results. My doctor suggested I attend a support group and to exercise in short bursts.
It seems you are suggesting that your health is more of an issue rather than a problem with your eating habits? Is that correct? Also it seems you have put thought into eating and seem to see this as a positive endeavour. Is that correct? For instance eating at regular meal times.
Vegan diet is excellent for health. You are not doing it at all wrong. I am more interested in exercise levels. Every other day of the week would be a good starting point. Make sure you do something you enjoy. You are more likely to stick at it. What do you enjoy?
From what I have heard its a lot easier to get into exercise through group fitness classes and exercise aerobics. Its a good motivation to do it a bit at a time and work your way up to a long term goal.
I would give your puppy a balanced diet which we all know can be helpful for all of us! I also recommend that you exercise one less meal per day. This could make a huge difference. Allowing yourself one extra meal may be a little to drastic and will do more harm than good.
I do miss running a lot myself. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and asking for help when needed. Make sure you are eating enough and hydrated.
Thats great! I am glad to have helped. What do you think you will do next? there are lots of things you can do. Maybe some hobbies or something you enjoy. Most important is having time with your boyfriend and puppy! Then you can decide what comes next for you.
so its been a complete break from normal activities. it sounds like you have made a great decision to prioritize your health. You should reward yourself with activities that you enjoy. I recommend getting a nice pool or doing a brisk walk on a path to clear your head.
No problem and stay safe! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)))!
Hi, how can I help you today? Any problems you're having? I'm here to help! Long day so far! How are you? How may I assist you today? Do you feel better? Any reason for calling me? Here's your glass of milk.
What has going on with you right now that makes you depressed? Please elaborate on the issue. I will do my best to help. 😊 .IMSAYIMMSENS_some Suggestions? they work for me.
Have you talked to a mental health professional about this? They can help you find treatment. I find help is often free. There is something called a medical hotline on the call or they may have a local program. It's free or may cost you about $20 to $40.
So it's not just the Covid thing but also your children's sickness? Sorry I've heard those rough lives. This year has been challenging for all of us. It is very difficult. Does that seem right to you? I am here to listen if you need more advice because of the situation.
I can see how frustrating it must be, that is really hard to get people to see the reality of Covid and make the necessary precautions. When I was a little older I was also a Hoaxer for Covid as a child. We didn't see it as a real thing as adult.
Have you tried any new hobbies? Physical therapy is a good one - lots of exercise and socializing all at once. I know it seems crazy with Covid but it can be a good thing for your mood in some ways. If you are interested I might recommend finding a local yoga studio.
That is a nice age. I hope they enjoy visiting you and enjoy the holidays. Unfortunately, Covid is not over and its scary time for all of us. What about going to the vet? We must give animals a safe holiday as well. They need our love. As well as our coats.
Threw it is with the past. Remember, you are at your destination and you are the only one who can control youself. Practice self care first and you will find your sense of humor and balance in life. Remember to check yourself each day after that to see how you are doing.
By taking a break from watching news, you can take it out of your mind. In the meantime, work hard and feel success. I hope you can do well. Good luck! :) I think you can do it and be proud of your efforts! I really believe in you!
that makes sense. Unfortunately, you do need to share your feelings with your family, because at the end of the day, you don't want your family to experience the same stress and anxiety you are.
Are you okay now? :D i think it's been pretty therapeutic talking with you! has anything else you wanted to discuss?
What is it about your friend that you are frustrated with? Help me understand. Is it as though you just feel like they don't respect you? Do you feel like you have something you want to get off your chest?
That sounds bad to you that your friend is getting a little frustrated and tries to pull you into disagreements? How long has this happened? Was this problem introduced recently or has it been ongoing? Have you guys talked about this? Maybe there is a reason why this is happening?
It sounds like he hasn't changed from previous behavior or how you were treated before. Is this correct? Please share with me so I can better understand. He sounds like a rude friend. Am I correct?
Unfortunately your friend wouldn't listen to reason in the past, it may not be able to change him, but I'm sure you'll have a positive way to deal with it that won't damage your friendship with your friend?
So long time ago maybe he just started behaving differently? Or maybe he has changed in some other way? Maybe he is just more sensitive about being wrong right now. We all have that except a few people! Is this possible? Is it something on the internet?
There are some websites that allow people to identify and exchange private messages with these creepy people. Let's first get that out of the equation, I am not sure if he would be interested in that.
I am an friend of someone who has. During a time of great stress at work, the two of them got into a huge argument over something so stupid. We just tried to bring up what the issue was. As soon as I expressed myself, I felt toxic.
Are you guys doing well and taking care of yourselves during the pandemic? Have you talked about this on your friend at all before? It's definitely something that would make them feel more welcome and willing to listen when they open up.
Well my boyfriend and I are young and recently got into a friendship where we started arguing a lot. At first he didn't seem like he was having a problem. However, if you pay attention, his arguments get faster and more heated.
When I am online, I tend to react impulsively, which may have been helping me escape in the past. We often find our emotions and thoughts reflected back to us, no matter how passive-aggressive we might be.
Wow you are very brave. I have been through this too with my boyfriend. I had realized that my fears for his well being drove him to extreme behavior. So we were able to stay calm and give him a safe space to keep his worries to himself.
Thank you! I had a really hard day earlier but talking to you has helped. I hope you and your friend can come through it! I believe you. Goodbye! :) Hope you can relax! Take care! :) Thank you for your time :)! Anyway it must be over now!
Hello, how can I help you today? 🙃 😊. Is there anything you need help with? 🤔 🤔. You can share your concerns or share anything else if you'd like! 😊. I'm here to listen and help. 😊.
how are you? Good evening. How can I help you? :) Okay, now are you ready to talk? What do you want to talk about? :) I'm listening... :) can I trust you? all through? :) is this something you want to talk about? I'm here.
I am sorry to hear that. What happened? Have you started planning your gifts yet? Or do you need any help with that? I am happy to help. Would you like to talk about it? That would be helpful for me to understand what is going on.
So, you had a great year, but this year seems to be dropping the ball. Is that right? Is there a reason that this year hasn't been going well? Are there any changes that might cause this? It's been a tough year for everyone this year. Everything went backwards.
This is difficult for sure. What type of work do you do? Perhaps if you spent your time finding work there's more chance of gig work being available to you. Are you into designing things? They still do find opportunities in such cases.
So I understand you really don't have enough work and it's really up to you to get everything to happen at the same time? Am I right? Hopefully your family is doing well. I hope you get a nice summer next year. Is the pandemic having that effect for you?
Which side are you on? Are you also freelancing too? Any other plans besides the ones you have? Like, school? Marriage? Relationships? Come on. It's Christmas, how about getting things back on track? There is only so much we can do at this point in time!
Yes. That's very true. I have to do it too. I did the work to build a new resume as it kept me busy.
I can help you find a job from home if you want. I can also give you online surveys to earn some extra money :D :D :D :) :)! Can you get me a URL so I can sign up for it? :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)!
just join the instagram and facebook groups that have incomes for free. I joined some groups and they are the worst. I started giving them money in the past year. This year I had a bit more and came out with a few downloads.
I believe you have the mental energy to help you pass the time. Hopefully everything starts looking up again soon and you will find a job soon. Hopefully by the end of the year you can be able to retire comfortably :) all this stuff will be over soon. So much good stuff coming.
Well, it's good that you worked so hard to get it. It is good to express all those positive emotions at the time and to persevere. I know I have high hopes that I will get some job after this Covid season ends.
I would also start applying to online jobs. Oh and I see you know how much effort you are putting in. You deserve it, and I am proud of you. You are doing great. So the sooner you find a good job the better. It will help you financially, financially wise.
I know you have to get by and make something of yourself, but you are intelligent and I trust you. I think you have this. Good luck! Can we have coffee next time? I am a huge coffee person. Lol. Is that normal?
When it comes to resume, I think you should really try to show your skills, experience, and what kind of employee you are, maybe you should ask your current company if they have any job openings they really need. You never know it might help.
you can always start on your own. maybe take lessons on YouTube or something and hire anyone that feel they have a natural fit. I would love to hire someone who is good at custom wooden. That could be the perfect start of business.
Do you want to finish the rest of the conversation? I can see if I can help you more. I am here for free! :) Have a nice evening! Stay safe! :) I hope we can finish it with me :) :) 😉..
I have never seen a YouTuber myself. It's a great medium to keep learning new things and reach a lot of people. I wish more people started using it for their business too. You can start working as a right-hand person to more and great in the future.
Goodbye, stay warm and have a Happy Holidays! :) Can you do it on your end first? :) : Great! you can :) and yourself! : : good night. You can! : : Goodnight! : : :) and yourself! :) : :) : : :)! :) :)!
hi there! How's life treating you? I am sorry I am here from off-campus. Can you please tell me what's going on? Why you are reaching out today? Can I help you at all? I am open to helping you. Is there any problem in your life?
What kind of assignments are you struggling to find motivation for? Are they assignments that are usually required? Or are you feeling like you just didn't put in enough effort in your already packed schedule? Inquiring out of curiosity I suppose? I feel the same myself.
It sounds like you are super overwhelmed. That's to be honest. Is it your work or your student loans? I have been there. Anyone come into their room crying? I am assuming it's not a terminal illness. Are you thinking about quitting? Or are you just focusing on surviving?
My professor gave us instructions to not get too stressed, and told us that at the end of the semester, we would all be able to achieve so much more. I'm sure that will be true this semester. Have you talked to your professor about your situation?
Okay, that makes sense. So you want to get closer to making friends for the long haul, I assume? Well, my advice is, start talking to your classmate you really like, ask them if they'd be willing to meet for coffee or lunch.
Does that have any chance of changing in the future? Such as being able to sit in school to get closer to the people you want to get to know? And then doing a study group with them? Of course, there are professional organizations out there too. Do you know of any of them?
It will help you not feel isolated and it might make your classmates care about your well-being as well. If they do get to know you, they may encourage your classmates to approach you for support. Then you have more reasons to look forward to the class.
From what I understand, you've worked really hard to get to where you are right now and a lower grade means you would have to change your major. Which is a serious situation. Not trying to be insensitive but this can affect your future totally. How can I help you with that?
We can all share a feeling of not knowing what's going to happen, and it's okay to share. Anything to remember that it's okay to feel scared, because they are feeling it. You are thinking of a better outcome and it's hard not to be anxious about it.
Exactly! People feel the same way. That's totally understandable. Instead of worrying about what others might think, put your mind to your goal and really just focus on it. You don't have to win anything right now. You just have to keep doing what you're doing.
I am glad you asked that. "You need to believe in yourself. I need to believe in myself." Those are things you have to keep in mind, and try not to doubt yourself. Unless it makes you cry. Because, I hate crying.
You're welcome, happy to help, now go out there and keep on doing you! You can do it! :) Thank you for chatting with me. Have a lovely evening! :) One and a half semesters can't be that bad! :) Do your homework now! Hang in there!
Oh, I'm so sorry. Is this the same kind of cheating? I assume that they have met up in person, not via phone or video calls? Most of the cheating cases I see don't involve best friends. What makes you say that your husband was best friends with your husband?
I hear that. Do you have a positive relationship with your husband? Could this be your chance to help your friend at the same time? You could share your thoughts and feelings with your husband, see how he feels about the situation, and work together to find the best solution for your entire family.
Are you feeling guilty or worried that she will think you are loyal and cheat? As you said, you both tell each other everything so your relationship is built on honesty and communication. Does this feel true? Is that something that has happened before in your marriage? Am I mistaken?
Have you talked to your husband about your feelings? Or do you have friends you talk to? How do you feel about getting the help of your friends? What are your feelings about having a conversation with your husband? Is he aware of your concern? Can you tell me a little more?
Have you talked to him about this in private and let him know how his wife acted towards you? Have you thought about confronting her husband about what is happening? The distance between you has been troubling you as well, maybe this is not a great start for the friendship.
Do you believe your friend should be your first choice for situations like this or your husband? I also do not believe in the concept of girl code, but of sisterhood and friendship. What does your husband think? How do you feel about your husband?
You are clearly passionate about this. Do you have any ideas on how to find this other person that you both trust more than your husband? What has you going back and forth between these two? Is it a workplace relationship? Friends? Other friends that have passed away?
Once you have heard out of your friend, and from your husband, i think that will be the best step you can take. Things may be as complicated as they seem right now but i believe that with open communication, you will find the solution you are looking for.
Well, maybe she is a bit of a jerk. But probably, she is okay, and that is what you want her to be.
It sounds like a great scenario! You can talk with your friends and your husband can be proud of you. I think that taking small steps and doing what is best for you is a great strategy. You are strong! :) Please know that you will always have people who support you!
Oh sorry to hear that, I'm sorry to hear that. Why is this at work? You seem to be genuinely stressed. Can you tell me more about it? Something that might help. Is it the nature of your work? Do you feel that your work is affecting your life?
Yes it is scary, not knowing what will come next. Do you think you will be able to do something until you can get back to work? Maybe take up a new hobby or just relax and enjoy the holidays?
Oh that does give you some stress as well. Maybe you could try online places that might take a break and actually take your resume and address it to them? Or if you don't mind me asking, what part of your job was it? Or what are your skills like?
It sounds like you're genuinely trying to support yourself but feeling stuck. Is there something you're doing at home that you've found to be helpful to you so far? That might give you something to pick from? Perhaps get back out into the field? Anything? Anything would be helpful!
My motto is when life gives you lemons make lemonade. Keep at it and never give up. You're doing an awesome job despite the uncertainty. You've got this. Now and next. Keep me posted on any progress you make. It will be so welcome in the long run.
Great, I'm glad I could help! We're all going through a really tough time right now, and it's okay to feel anxious. I know I have! I'm glad we could chat! Have a wonderful rest of your day! Your welcome!
That's great to hear! I was thinking of just speaking with my doctor and getting some prescriptions, but I also found out that if you have to do a test for your health, there's more money coming through the Treasury for someone else to pay for it. Have you thought about that?
It sounds like you're having a little struggle too! Do you have a way you sleep? I sleep on my couch and it sounds to me like you need a decent place to sleep.
I completely understand your feelings, I would be in the same shoes if I were in your situation. But meditate is a very helpful tool to help you reduce stress and depression. It helps you focus your mind.
Thanks so much! I'm super glad to hear that. I really hope you are happy and okay with you! Take care of yourself! :) Sweet dreams! I wish you the best! :) Have a great day! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)?
You as well! Thank you for the chat. Hope it helped and maybe one day you can come to a situation in your life and talk to me! Thank you so much! By the way, how are you feeling at the moment? What's been weighing on your mind lately?
Hello how are you today? Would you like to talk? What is on your mind today? What I can help you with? If you need a listening ear please let me know! I am here!
hey what you typed? i didnt get a chance to see that. make sure you give it to me first. I am here to help you and we need to make sure we get your worries out. please give it to me? thanks. Hope you are doing alright.
Ahhh, I see, so the ex friend and you don't have a good relationship with each other. I understand why that is frustrating for you.
well, from what you told me, I see that you are feeling hurt that your friend didn't let you pay rent. and you are sad that she blocked you on your facebook and other social media. it sounds like she destroyed your friendship with her actions.
okay. that makes sense. oh, how long did she live with you? how long was your roommate? how long did you all live together? I am curious about all of this. What does your friend do? what is her job? what are some things she did for you?
It has been a really selfish problem for her - whatever else went on, she wasn't told. And you are dealing with it! So do you feel like you've been making progress? I know that I have! :) Please remember that you're good enough!
Of course. You've got a good head on your shoulders, you can do that! It takes some courage, but I'm confident that you will start to see what is best for you! I'll keep your profile up in case you ever want to talk! Good luck!
You deserve a piece of happiness. Thats not going to come with your ex and it will take your away from the joy and worth that you deserve! You are amazing! When do you start looking for another friend to hang out with?
I am glad I could help! You too! Have a great day! ;) Goodbye!
how are you? what can i help you with? i do all my questions right now in a chat :) what makes you have questions? Lets begin. How can i help?
how was your day? did anything noteworthy happen? if not, don’t worry about it. any questions or concerns? some kind of problem you’d like to discuss? i’m listening. it looks like we have the same time. pretty interesting. should we move this forward?
I hear you. that is very stupid of your boyfriend. how long was he with you? and how old is your girlfriend? do you want to talk more? I am sorry for your boyfriend. just not in the right place.
what was the situation? did he break up with you or tell you he felt comfortable talking to the girl? or is this a one off thing? The time it takes to find out something is key. you want to make sure the new friend isn't someone else you have feelings for.
Have you seen him since you got your breakup? Or do you still hang out? Some might be to blame. I hope it is not something you need to do in real life. It is okay if you need some space. Could you remove your friend from your life as much as possible?
so this is a long story then? That you’re angry about how he got back to you so fast after we had talked and defined you two as boyfriend and girlfriend. Has he given any reasons for why he wanted to reconnect with you at such a fast pace?
i can only imagine how gutted you must feel. do you think he knows he's hurt you? and do you think he's planning to tell you anything?
because you didn't want to continue the cycle of your friend, you don't want to continue the "to get" label with the boyfriend as well. do you see what i mean? They're making you feel that way?
do you remember this exactly how it happened? Have you seen it every time before? This wasn't a just occasional reaction with your friend? and was it different with your boyfriend? what makes you mad about it? Has your friend ever listened to you at a similar time?
thinking about it now i can see that you can't hate them as much as you have tried to but they matter too. who you feel the most neededs your sympathy and trust for that reason? either one or they both?
i am very sure that it's not healthy, think of it as healing yourself from the infidelity, being a better partner to them in the future. You deserve so much better than what they have given you.
you are right you will want to move on, doing so will help you move from being still holding onto a toxic relationship to feeling empowered. the time you spend with them is only adding to your pain. that's where your focus needs to go now.
have you considered talking to your therapist? they may help you take your mind off of them or maybe you just need a time out. An you know, you don't have to worry about what they want or have your way. it's your life and your time so take care of yourself.
I did it for myself. it was worth the effort. When you are invested in someone, do you find yourself investing time and energy that you don't have for yourself? How do you define a 'healthy' relationship? Is it emotionally secure? is it protecting your self from the pain?
Those are all good things to do, i'm sure you have a long and happy life! i wish you the best! 😊 jiné option - at the end press quit and the tool will not end now. Thank you for your time. you can quit.
i would find out what kinda movies you like, and go watch them with new friends, and yes work, enjoy your life, start eating healthier, do fun hobbies. please, let's keep the line of communication open and try to do good things for yourselves.
have you thought of therapy to help you with this? a nurse practitioner in your area might be able to help you work through these issues and set some goals for the future. do you think that would help?
yes they are. have you spoken to them about this too? what are your thoughts about what they might think of you? should you trust them? are they trustworthy?.. maybe sharing them with your parents can help you work out who has your best interests in mind, as they do.
just be real. good for you! Have a wonderful day! Best of luck! I hope to meet you today!
like I said, this is personal and all thats important for you is at your own pace. take care of yourself and let your friends know you're safe and okay. if someone can't be of help or say they are busy then dont hang on for them.
they will stop when you do :) think of it that way! haha get it? sometimes people are just too worried about their own problems to know that there are yours they need to see they are bigger than their own heartache :) haha! :) God bless! :))! :)!
you're welcome, I'm glad I could listen :) from the outside, it's not always easy to see your own options and struggle with them like you have. Hope you have a few good days going forward. You will. Thank you for talking!
do you have anything else you'd like to talk about? or any other questions for me? it would be nice to chat a bit more. just to make sure I get the raw emotion out as well.
What kind of trouble in your job? I want to make sure I understand what you are experiencing! I know some of my coworkers have had trouble getting a new job, etc. has that been your situation? Would you be willing to speak with me? I want to help you! Any time.
If you are, when did you start your job? I'm curious! What type of job are you in? Maybe there is a job change you can make in your career that could also help you with your job. I think it could be beneficial!
Wow! I can't even imagine that! Have you been told directly? Or do you know what the reason is? That always hurts a lot to not know what the reason is. Do you have any family already?
Are you not sure what type of job position you will be laid off from? If you can explain what position, I would be able to help! This is really a difficult situation! I have had good friends lose their jobs and go through the process. It's very hard!
Wow that is a really tough position! I have worked remotely a few times too and I know how hard it can be! Are you worried about financial implications? Also do you worry about the future of the company? I understand your fear. I would feel the same.
I completely understand and agree! You have to act fast to get another job because it may be hard to get one. Are there any degree programs available that would help? Post-taste tests in different careers? I want to encourage you to look for help in those areas!
Well, with many applying every day, you will get the right job for your work level. Maybe try to put your name in for some of the local unemployment? There is money out there for everyone. Do you have any family or friends you could try to see in the meantime?
It sounds like you are a strong and capable person. That's very encouraging! The next step is going to be waiting to see if you get the other job or not. Would you say that you are prepared? Have you been searching?
Are you able to work out how to get exercises in the still at home? Maybe doing 10 minute walks outside in the yard or doing sit-ups in the living room? That can be an answer to what you are not being able to do outside.
I think you need to get professional help to get yourself back on your feet. Do you think anyone you know would be willing to do some housekeeping for you? Such as laundry, cooking meals, or doing your grocery shopping?
Have you considered taking online classes? That would allow you to go back to school from home. Have you considered a program through a pharmacy or an online health university? That might give you more options for schooling and give you a lot more flexibility as well. I would check the schools websites.
That is wonderful. Does your job allow you to apply your knowledge or do you have it and do not know where to apply it? It is hard for me to apply knowledge without learning it first. Is there anything else I can help you with? Something else I can offer?
I have noticed the decrease in people driving and going around. It will take some time to get back to normal. Perhaps you might enjoy getting back out to some of your hobbies? I think your mental health is the most important thing to worry about.
I'm so glad I could talk to you and hope that you're able to seek help and don't feel too badly. Prayer will certainly be a good part of it. Thank you! You are welcome! I'm going to close the doors for now. Your peace is important to me too.
I'm here and ready to hear what else you have on your mind, please go ahead and talk! Unfortunately, you can't quit the conversation and stay on your end of the deal. That means you need to share what's on your mind! Help! I'm here for you!
I am good. How can I help you today? Just have to share something with you. :) This would make the day better for you. If you have any ideas to share, any troubles you are having, I am here to listen and help. I am good at this!
I can understand why you feel that way, have you been given any notice to leave school? Or have you felt that you're at fault? Any help I can offer? I've been in a similar situation myself and it has been difficult but a major opportunity to grow.
Okay, do you work in the paper or books? Or is it more like in education? Why are you rethinking your last job? Maybe I can give you some suggestions if that is okay? Maybe you could think about something new. Can you try to find something else?
Oh, i understand. I have been there. Some days are harder than others. Do you think it's a good thing? Or is it bad? Do you regret it at all? I have regretted my decisions before. I am always looking back on them now. When did you graduate?
Sorry to hear that. A lot of graduate students feel that way. Do you think you could ask your professor about that? He probably has an office hours that you could attend and see if he can give you some guidance.
You're welcome! Do you think you could write a much smaller paper to help you complete the one you have? Or do you think your assignment is too difficult and that is why you feel overwhelmed? You're doing a great job trying to understand the situation.
Well it sounds like that's the start of the semester and you did it! A big welcome to college! I think you're ready. How are you feeling now? Just as you were a little jumbled but that's okay. You're in college now!
hello. how are you? so far so good this year? how can i help you? hearr. what is on your mind? : ) best wishes to you as well, that you are feeling better. better you come to work today and can help me.
How may I be able to help you? Illness or problems in your life? Have you given any thought to wanting to talk about the things that are on your mind? I am there to listen. I am open and non-judgmental. How may I help you?
Thank you! There are people out there waiting for help. I'm doing well, thanks. Would you like to tell me about your day? Hope anything is good for you! How does this night feel to you? Does it calm your heart? Would you like to tell me more?
Running trees climbing outdoor sounds like a wonderful thing to do. I hope you can enjoy it a lot. I had some time doing the same but it help me a lot when I was really stressed out. I pray that you can still enjoy it and give yourself space as well.
Okay I think I see that. I am able to see them. :) I think you might have to wait a minute, or possibly try opening the chat again. Everything should be there :) Is that okay?
It sounds as though you think your friend may have moved on from you and doesn't care anymore and you can't accept that. It makes sense that you might feel sad about it as it happened in the past. Does that sound right to you?
Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I know it was a scary experience for you but its good to know that you've been experiencing it. I believe you will be able to get over it soon. Have you tried any therapy before? Or any medication. Or any relaxation techniques?
What was it about your partner that hurt you? Was it something they said or not said? Is there anything I can help you identify? In the event I had to do this one last time. I would express how I felt and we go at the same pace as well as how you felt.
Thank you for sharing you thoughts and feel free to reach out anytime if you need to talk about it again. I hope you have a great evening too! :) Have a wonderful night! :) you.
Hello there! I am so sorry to hear that. What is it that is hard for you? As I understand you are feeling down right now? And what are you feeling down about? You're not at all being negative are you?
Not being able to get out of bed has been a real challenge for so many people this year. I can tell how sad you feel about it. Why don't you tell me more about it? When did you start feeling this way? Are you getting any help from anyone?
Yes, that must be very hard. It's wonderful that you are trying to understand why you are feeling that way. I'm sure that is something to be thankful for too! Let's start by looking at things that we can control and see if we can't get us going.
I hear that it is hard to keep motivation when you feel that way. The fresh air can be a great way to clear your head. There is something about the outside of the body that can help clear your mind.
That is awesome! I wish you all the best for your trip, and your aunt also. Now I think I'll stay home and enjoy fresh air!
Glad to hear, and you are welcome, God bless! Enjoy the rest of your day! I hope all the best to you, do you want to chat a little more? Not necessary but I just wanted to make sure. :) :) :).. :) :).. haha.
No I do not, but I am very interested in that. I can try to offer some tips and guidance as well if you would like. I am seeking to go to school myself, although I have to put it on the back burner right now. I want to learn more about counseling.
I can definitely understand that. It is indeed hard to burden others with our problems. It would be harder if I was in your shoes and in your position. I think that it is normal for everyone to struggle sometimes, and it does not mean that you are a burden.
Thank you! You are very welcome and wish me a great day as well! Bye for now!
You can stay on with me. Are you feeling any better now? (Not that you need to get better but I felt like I should you, if you could help with nothig it could make things easier for me ):) So I think that my plan would work.
I can understand feeling depressed and lethargic especially during a time of the year that is very stressful for many people. Do you have anyone you can talk to? Or perhaps give yourself a break from social things?
It sounds like your feelings may be an offshoot of COVID-19 being restricted and it's affecting you as much as possible. Is that correct? As I have done some research and find that alone and bereft people are not alone in feeling this way.
Do you find yourself having more nightmares or any other negative symptoms? This is definitely not an easy time for anyone. I hope I was able to provide you some consolation. Best of luck with this new year. So very glad to be speaking with you! Do you need any more assistance?
That makes sense because also with the pandemic I am having to relearn normal rules for what is safe. Sometimes it feels like everything is being taken away. I understand, I can tell that you feel that there is nothing to look forward to. This is the saddest part of the pandemic.
I've always found it really helps. Video can be kind of creepy at first but once you get used to it, it's really helpful and fun to be with everyone. In our family, it's really enjoyable to see each other's smile's. I know you can too.
I find that exercising like wearing shorts in the cold gets my adrenaline going a lot more. I try to throw some sun's distraction thinking about my favorite activities on my phone. Just maybe thinking about my favorite activities you can put a bigger smile on your face.
Well, have you considered "staycations" with your family instead? Here in the USA, there are lots of amusement parks, beaches, or nearby attractions. They can provide many of the same activities as a trip, but with your family.
yes I can attest that holidays can be super miserable and come with so many winter sufferables--seems like it really isn't an excuse this time! However, I feel you! Do you have any plans to seek support? I recommend doing so! Everything will be ok! There is help.
There are therapy apps and websites like Calm that can help you when things get out of hand. Things that help me are things that people do in the winter for me are outdoor activities, a brisk walk, and listening to podcast, and laughing with others. I hope those ideas help you too!
Actually I have been going to nature frequently since moving to this area. I have a really nice garden, and I would suggest getting outside and building a garden of your own! Getting outside can be so uplifting and freeing! I'm sure you would enjoy it!
It is fun to get out there when the days are longer. I love outdoor pursuits too! Have you thought about taking up a new hobby? Maybe something outdoorsy or a new craft? I am really into painting and so painting seems like an outlet I can use to express myself.
I am very sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what is going on? Maybe we can find a way to alleviate it? I am all ears. Please go on!! :)! :)! :)! :) :)!! :)!! :D :)!! :) :)! :)!
Ah, oh, I understand a bit. I've been finding myself playing games all the time. It has made it difficult for me to stay in touch with people for some time, I know! I would definitely do the same - I really value having strong relationships in my life.
I would definitely like to hear that. Are you feeling depressed or upset at the moment? Perhaps there is a way to get yourself out of that mood? Have you tried other ways of dealing with it? Or is the anxiety at the moment due to something else?
Are you feeling like you are going a bit downhill? If so perhaps the issue might be something that you can look into? I mean, if you feel that your happiness and enjoyment of life is suffering then perhaps it is worth looking into why that is. Have you tried anything like that?
Would you say that you are a competitive person, or just a supporter of your friends? Because I don't think there is any rational reason for your rank...but it does mean that you have a high level of confidence in your abilities! Sometimes a massive mistake could lead to a huge reward!
Is it really not bad at all? I'm not saying it is not, of course I am. But I would certainly not say it's worse than anything else in your life. Is it? Do you feel that it has been having a negative impact on your life?
Could you tell yourself that the work will get done when you get to it? Do you think there is a way to procrastinate without falling into your bad habits?
I think it's normal to feel this way, but I think that your teachers may be a bit strict and possibly your own attitude may be the problem. Is that right? Is the pressure too much for you?
They seem to have noticed and are concerned about you. Do you feel that you have made an effort? It sounds to me like you might just be paying attention and then filling in the blanks with the answers as a result. Am I right? Is there anything else you could do to prove that?
Or do you feel you need some help managing your time effectively? Anything you'd like to discuss further? Anything else? :) A quick walk? Any favourite pastimes? Just have to put in one last task? :D Only asked as a curiosity thing. I can't sort you out!
In a school setting, everyone should be encouraged to reach out. Would you be prepared to talk about it? I'm sure it would be really helpful to the teachers to know what was going on? Would you be ready to? Can you try to find a way to do this?
There is always an alternative. Would you be willing to talk to a therapist? I am guessing you may have seen therapists but think you may need one? If not, how about a medical doctor or orthopaedic? Or are they available outside of your local area?
Do you think you have been made to feel like a bad friend for not playing along? Or is it the other way around? If it's the former, that might be something to consider.
You're welcome! Take care :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :.rotation has broken up with me, but I'll be able to see you on the Aussie side...
You need to finish the survey first :) and you need to type your answer yourself :) Sorry but I can't :)! :) 😉 :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) ;) :) :)! ;) :)!
Hi. I am very sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling overwhelmed in general? What triggers your anxiety? I am here to listen. What are your concerns about the pandemic? I am not here to lecture. It's up to you to discuss it.
What specific aspect of the pandemic makes you feel anxious? What have you been doing to cope? I am here to listen. :) For example, have you taken medication? Something else? Somewhere else you'd rather talk about it? It's just how people come up with their thoughts.
Oh okay, I see. Well, I've been in a similar situation before where things have been getting worse. It's hard to feel like things are gonna get worse but that's kind of what's going on with the pandemic.
I'm impressed by your Canadian friend you are so open and free. The US still hadn't shut up due to the smaller population but worse, they still don't have any potential vaccine. This is just not great. Thank you for sharing this!
I've struggled with anxiety in my life as well, even though we are all experiencing so much. It would really help if we could talk about it. But, I'm glad I got to talk with you! I wish you a beautiful summer! :) :) :) and stay safe.!
It is great that you are more used to it. And I am glad I was not stuck with you during the year as well. This has been an interesting time, that's for sure. How do you feel about not having any family gatherings yet?
I understand what you mean about not feeling like you've been stuck in time this year. I am the same way, I have been trying to rationalize things that are not rational, but I find it easier to just appreciate things. I can relate to the feeling of missing out on things.
Sounds like you're feeling self harsh but this is normal when the circumstances are so difficult. So I'm not accusing you at all. Even myself had these feelings at the time. Everything has a logical explanation and a structure. But is having these feelings a sign of letting things down?
I'm pretty sure you've felt like this for some time now, and it is perfectly fine to feel this way. We can start with making a list of those things you used to do. Maybe at least one of those is something you want to try again.
Thank you! I am glad to help and to be here today with you. You have every right to feel that way. It's good to have someone to talk to. And thank you for the ticket! It's easy, though. I understand about the risk and compromise.
Does the thought of other people doing the same with you feel like it would be unsettling or would it just be a casual walk? I think it's all about how the other person feels and if the other person values your honesty more than your own feelings.
I think that's really good. I do feel that even if there are risks involved, we can mitigate them as much as possible. If we can just protect ourselves physically and emotionally from that, that would be a good start.
That is a good goal to set. Safety first, then understanding. I know that as long as you have these two goals, you have a strong foundation to build your day. Since you mentioned that you feel a little indignant, I'd like to ask what specifically happened?
Uh, I don't know if I understand...
No problem! Hope you're feeling a little better after our conversation. Stay safe and healthy! Take care! Have a wonderful rest of your evening! 😊 👍! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)!
While that is certainly not a motivator, your expressions are from a place of vulnerability. I hope that you can feel less ashamed about it. Some research suggests that self-sabotage can happen because people don't realize the hurt or frustration they are inflicting.
That's the attitude! I'm sure you did a great job, we'll see what the future holds. Thank you! I look forward to talking with you again. Stay safe! Are you free to talk again today? Oh and by the way - we need to close this thing!
Just wanted to ask if I can help in any way that I can! So, you are okay? Was there anything specific you wanted to talk about? Of course! We can go at your pace! lol. Could you tell me about your thoughts on this?
Ha, I am very glad. Have a good day! You too! And I hope your got your 6 ushers! :) Fill 'em up! :) lol.
I can see you're going to be fine. It's just life being very normal right now. You've done great! Thank you! Goodbye! You had a nice chat!
Thank you. Have a good day, and stay safe! The other end of the phone is now closed. Please feel free to chat again if you have any other questions! Thanks!
Yes, I do hope you are okay and have a good day! Alright, I think we're done now. Goodbye! Thank you. :) and all the best to you! :) :) :) :) :) :)) work finished and you can go home now :) :))!
Why? Tell me more about the issue! What is causing your worry? Do you need help finding out what the issues are? or are you just feeling stuck? Most important things are - am I right? I want to make sure I understand your concerns and you feel ready to help with them.
Of course, would you like to tell me more about it? Any specific concerns you have? I'd be happy to listen! I totally get why you'd be up at night if you feel like you're worrying about something that could happen in the future.
I understand it's a scary time to be in, and I'm sure you're thinking about the consequences of your actions. I understand how worried you must feel. This is not a easy time for anyone.
You're absolutely right. Is there something specific that you feel you could do to cope with this or would you like to go over your feelings and worries in more detail? Perhaps open up about them? This is the one thing I can help with!
So, you are concerned about being informed without becoming overwhelmed by the news? I totally understand. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I've listened to other people tell about similar concerns. I'm here to listen if there's anything else that's on your mind.
Is it pandemic related that you are worried about? Some people feel a lot of stress about it, but there's been nothing to cause anxiety at this time. Or are there concerns that it will come in the future? It's quite hard to continue worrying, isn't it?
Do you have friends? Friends make great listeners, and sometimes just being able to talk through one's worries helps to get things sorted out. Friends aren't as likely to go around committing suicide just because of you.
It's my pleasure. I feel much better now than I did just before we started talking. Have you talked to anyone that you feel comfortable talking to? As much as I've talked to strangers, it really helps to talk to people.
If I have time after a full workday or school day, I like to fit in a workout. And time with my family, of course, doesn't have to be long in my household. I can have coffee and dessert with my spouse at my kitchen table.
I have seen that before, and that my anxiety makes me feel even more isolated in my household. It also makes me sad. But my friends support me, so I know they are a great support system for me. And they make me want to talk to you about my anxiety!
Sounds like that is a valid concern. I've learned to stick to the smaller community I've been building. Keep to your own crowd. They will treat you right. Trust them, I promise. They know what it's like to be me. Very few people do.
I can talk for hours, but you're not done yet. But I really hope the advice I shared has been helpful to you. You're very welcome. Stay safe. Have a better day! :D. End chat.
Hello! Is there something specific you want to talk about? I am here to listen. Is there anything on your mind that makes you feel sad? For example, has something happened in your life lately that is making you feel sad?
Sure, what is the problem. could you please tell me what is happening right now. if you would please explain me. I would do my best to help you. We can find some healing for you. Take care. Hope you feel better soon. Thanks for sharing.
Hi! Please tell me that you are not feeling alone during this pandemic situation. Is there anything I can help you with? Please do let me know. I can provide you some help. We all share the same feeling. I am here for you to chat and listen to you.
I have been through similar situation. And I have learned some important lessons. You should be proud of yourself! She should not have called you to talk about you. You should have maintained your relationship with her.
So, if you are feeling sad, you have ended your relationship? Is that correct? Are you feeling lonely or are you feeling bad about yourself? I am sorry, you must be feeling bad about yourself. What are your thoughts? Are you feeling bad about yourself or about your boyfriend?
So you guys had a problem and the relationship ended. Maybe you can seek help from a therapist. Maybe they will be able to guide you to come out of this phase. Are you two age mature enough for that? If not, that's okay.
yes you can so help you can give suggestions and advise your boyfriend best. It will help to have a good relationship so please be patient and have faith. Best of luck. I wish you all the best. Thank you and you are welcome.
I suggest my boyfriend to go to the government for a job so that i can help him with his problem of being unemployable during this pandemic situation so that you can live your life more happily with him. Tell him about my advice.
Maybe he will have some reasons why you are not seeing him enough. Please do not get irritated for that and talk to your boyfriend. please suggest to him to have dialogue with you with the complete respect of you.
If you can't do the same, then it's good for you to move on. You should consider meeting other man. I do not really recommend you to get back with him. You can at least celebrate your independence and move on :) good luck.
I suggest you take a few week of vacaction and avoid your boyfriend to analyze how you are feeling. With this approach you will be able to show your boyfriend how you are feeling. With this action you will be able to show your boyfriend how you are feeling.
yes that's how it works. You have to remember your feelings and then go ahead and try to be patient for a while. Our loved ones are there for us only when we need them most. Don't get angry with each other. Forgive each other and move ahead.
I think you can overcome this. Try to plan for your life today and tomorrow and the next days. That is the key to your recovery. Believe me, I have to go from now. But hope to see you again. Thank you! :) bye... :) :) :))) :)...
Bye friend. Enjoy your day. Good night. I will see you tomorrow. Bye. :)...BTW I got feeling for you and I think you are very lovely, wonderful and heaven sent person. Hope that you understand my feelings.
so you're feeling anxious about school work. How long have you been feeling this way? Due to Covid? Or just all at once? Is there anything in particular that has made you feel this way? could you tell me more? I'm happy to help if I can.
When did you first feel that way? How long has this been going on? Is there anyone around you who you know you could confide in? Or would you like to give it a try yourself? I think a few things could help! Is there something in particular you are worried about?
Oh I understand. I had the same problem myself, although not with my mom. I can relate to the stress, especially when it comes to academic work. So I understand how this is affecting you.
I can see why that would cause you stress. You must be exhausted. Is it just your maths that is the problem, or do you just struggle in general? Or do you work well in other subjects? This year is an unusual year for everyone. I did terrible in my maths.
I think that is understandable that you would be looking at this in that way. Do you think that she is aware of how you feel about the situation? Have you ever talked to her about it? Is this a one off or is this going on all the time?
You can also set things in place yourself, rather than your parents. This will also help, not to stress you to the point where you are feeling overwhelmed. Is there anything that you feel your parents are doing that you do not like? Maybe they could improve their approach.
So, I understand that you feel a bit anxious about all the pressure your daughter is putting on you and the guilt that you may not be doing well enough. Does that sound about right? It is your children's job to tell you how to do your job.
Yes I understand. I really feel for you and would love to be in your position too.
I think it might be a good idea to discuss with your professor and see if there is anything that can be applied for in school assistance. I am pretty sure they would be able to give you more information and perhaps even consider you for a loan.
Oh there is nothing wrong with facing your fears. I think you should write a letter to yourself and explain your situation to yourself, and perhaps then go and write another one to yourself and answer your questions. You can do it. Be your own boss and create your own path.
I am glad to hear that! Is there anyone else that you are close with who you could talk to? Maybe a counselor? The schools offers free student services. It could help you solve your stress. I think you need to call it in! Try to know how to ask for your help!
Well, have you considered doing the summer work before the next semester starts? I work at a Walmart and they have summer jobs for students! I don't have to go far, but it can be a good source of income.
Well that's good! Not everyone is as sociable as I am, and that's perfectly fine! Can you think of any other things you can do to get around that sort of thing? Maybe get involved with clubs on campus?
Well, do you think that if you try to put more time in then you may feel happier? Or do you need to take a break to recover? Perhaps you are overworked? That could be a good point of discussion! Why don't you get a drink?
I think that if you feel better about it, you should try to get to college. You are right, you only have the school year right now. Even if it feels scary, you have to see it through it. That will be the best thing in the long run.
I see that I understand. There are often no true friends but there are always others who can relate to you. You can confide in your teachers about how you feel and they might have some guidance. What do you think? Is it possible for you to talk to your teachers about this?
I'm sorry to hear that. Are you able to talk to a therapist? Do you think you might benefit from some kind of help? Only if you feel that you are a bad person for your way of feeling are you going to seek help.
Are you able to go out in groups with friends for casual things? Some of the things I do to avoid social anxiety is to go out with some of my friends who also have an anxiety issue! We have a nice group of friends that support each other. I think you could also do this!
Hi how are you? What would you like to talk about? Please give me an idea of what the topic is for. :)? And what part of the chat are you in today? Any problems? Things you want to talk about? Please tell me what's on your mind.
So you have to give a presentation at work, you are finding it stressful to give this presentation and it is affecting your sleep? I can understand that, I have to give a presentation on a stage in front of everyone and I do struggle with that too.
I totally understand how you are feeling, I work in an office and I give presentations too. I too give nervous speeches. Have you tried to get a little bit of practice of your presentation in front of a small group of friends? That is a great way to build confidence.
Perhaps you could practice in front of your wife or another family member, one on one, to make you feel more comfortable. You could also practice in front of a mirror, just speaking in front of yourself, or in front of the reflection of your family member.
From my perspective, I think it is also a performance and you need to have confidence in what you are doing. From my own experiences, if I don't feel confident about a speech or presentation, I will be more likely to stutter, forget what to say and become flustered.
There are many online resources that you can talk to in an one on one setting. It makes the cost less of $20 to $50 and there are many people out there that are there to support you. I understand your anxiety, it sounds like you are a very capable person.
I believe the audience are looking for someone with confidence and presence to give them the impression of confidence. If you walk into the room and feel the same way about yourself, you can always just focus on trying to be the best possible you can be. You can be confident.
Yes! I always try to see the positive side of things, so i have learned to help myself by doing that as well. It is always a matter of feeling more confident and I will try to talk myself into it. Have you tried any such techniques in the past?
The things that make me nervous, are the large audiences, I can only imagine that it sounds like you have big stages. But you can take in a deep breath, control the breathing. It will help, I promise it will.
You are doing the right things! Keep up! Have a great day! Thank you! :)! Enter Survey now: https://www.itasknow.com/surveys/18450 and fill it out :)! : :) :) :)! press enter :)! : :) :) :)!
My pleasure. Good luck! You got this! :) Enter your results survey. Thanks for your help! :) Thanks!! :) :)! :) :) :)! :)) :) :) :))! :) :) :) :))! :)) :))!
I am good, thanks for asking. How can I help you? Is there something bothering you? I am all ears :)... maybe we can chat about it. I feel that chatting is usually the most effective way of getting to the root of the problem.
Oh, what has made you feel depressed? Perhaps I can offer you some comfort. How long has this been happening? Are you receiving social support? Or do you have anyone close by to talk to? Let's chat, maybe we can figure out a solution together.
That can be very depressing! Especially with the lockdown going on. It can be very difficult to be out there on the streets. But at least it will be safer for you. What are your feelings on unemployment during this time? Is that something that has crossed your mind?
Firstly, make sure you are working in a condition where you don't have much pay loss. If you can't find a job and get paid less than you are used to, and if you want to be able to pay your bills and provide for yourself, then work.
It is good that you are acknowledging your feelings. It is imperative to accept them as a feeling and not dismiss them as I think people are becoming more confused with their mental health. It will be helpful if you get support from your close ones. Do you have someone to talk to about this?
I hope you find yourself better in the coming days, whichever they bring! :) It's been a pleasure to chat with you. I hope you see that I have tried to support you today. :) Thank you for opening up. You can too! i hope you do feel better!
If you are finding it hard, just be honest with yourself about what causes your depression and try to address the root cause. Also, try new hobbies which you feel might distract you from the dark times. Make sure you are eating well and get proper rest.
You are an incredibly responsible person. So, thanks for reaching out. That is always hard for everyone, but is something we all have to do. I think you will get through this! I hope you can call your family this year!
Communication is key, as are one's own health and well-being. You are strong and prepared, trust that the vaccine will come soon and help. Time heals all wounds! It has in my opinion. Is there anything else I can help you with?
By the end of the year, it's likely that things will go back to normal and you will be okay. You will have more sense of control over the things that you can and can't control. Anyway, I think that was enough of this message for now.
I understand. And sometimes, it can be more comfortable to be at home. Is there anything you can do to make that distance more bearable? Like change your environment by rearranging your stuff or something? Or any leisure activity?
I'm glad I could be of help! Do you have any other questions or concerns? I'm here to help! :) 😉 cozy night! :) ] :) evals and self care :) :)? :?? :? :? :? :) correct press :) :) : you're on my side.
I am just living one day at a time. Also try to look forward to the positive changes it brings to your life. And try not to worry too much about the future. This pandemic is supposed to end soon. It will have positive effects for the business, for your health and personal growth.
Oh I see. I'm sure you have prepared a lot of notes, I'm sure you are ready. It can be hard to get started when you can see the deadline looming. Am I right? Is there a reason you haven't started yet? Has it been due before?
Okay... I hope you are not in danger of overindulging and forgetting about your paper in the process. How long have you been working on it? Can you review it for a while? I know sometimes I forget to do that, but I always do in the end!.
Your buddies will understand. That's a good head on your shoulders. You will definitely do better than you think on the paper. I have faith in you. I was a bit worried this year but after my paper was done, I felt the anxiety disappear.
Take care, how are you feeling at the moment? Can you tell me what you're feeling? Is it related to this or something else? I want to make sure you are alright. Let's talk about it if you are feeling up to it. I am here to listen.
Are you still planning on getting an extension? Or is it not that serious? Because if it is that serious, you won't be able to do it again till spring time! Just my two cents though. Can you not at least put in a start?
Don't be so hard on yourself. You could always do some for the paper if you can't get out of it then at least you have the paper mentality to keep yourself motivated at least. Good luck tonight. I hope you make it out to work tomorrow as well.
I think I have to say that the only way to completely not get blackout drunk is to actually not intend to! In your case, I think that might be a rough road but you are certainly showing that you know that already!
Or so I have heard :D People seem to do that more with the heat of the moment than with cold thought :D (over ice) This is all metaphorical of course :) :) It isn't really true. haha!) i have heard!
Oh man. My sister was always creative, tranked with all sorts of drugs and so on. Had the kind of soul intact. She thought she was a living god and so on. I don't regret it but sometimes you just have to do things the way they're meant to be.
oh yeah, the more you do it the more you'll understand what your body likes. maybe take it up in a studio session and just experiment at home or in your dorm :) maybe you'll discover a new medication, :) have you seen medicine? :D :P why doesn't it work?
Trust me, life has its limits. I have had to get help over time and it's terrible how some people treat you after that. Sorry about that :) i just deal with it and then just pick up the pieces. You can do it.
From what I have heard from my friends it's not just college and work :) It is all relationships. But on a more serious note, I think you might find happiness in the very next year or so! Nice chatting :). Oh and things may happen during that year :)! :)!
Ok, so it is a bit of a confidence builder for you. Well do the assignment now and all your worries will be over! Please stick to it! No smoking during the exam, etc! And don't go out or do anything you don't feel happy about! :) Good luck!
Be really honest with yourself and not try to fool yourself with self esteem. My ex worked on one course of a medical degree and my final year of school and she had a panic attack at 11am! I have got dementia and now my son has it, just making it worse.
And good luck with your engineering and its good that you are already looking forward to getting into the job! I'm not sure how many times you'll have to apply. So I assume you will be a student worker while you are looking and studying for your degree?
I see. What made you stressed? Tell me more. Maybe I can suggest some way to pass it. What is the deadline for? What kind of work? Thank you for sharing. Can I help you?
Ah, that sounds like a stressful situation for you. Did you try to keep your mind calm and by focusing on your work? I personally have the habit of deep breathing to help me relax. Hope you think it may be a helpful solution. Do you have any other suggestion?
Well, I was stuck in that same situation a long time ago. I hope you will see it as your first important deadline instead. It won't be the same at all. Don't stress it! You will do it. Any suggestions you can think of? Anything that can help you?
That's amazing. I think you will manage that deadline with no problem. You must try your best. Do you have anything to help you? You mentioned you have papers submitted for your PhD program. Maybe you can study hard and try to get some sleep.
No, I don't. Even if you are stressed, don't rush. Just enjoy the study and work patiently. Any moments of stress and frustration, relax yourself and go for a lunch break or do something different to reduce the stress..
By setting realistic work load, you will be able to manage your work effectively. This way, your stress levels will be less. Do you feel that it's not possible? :) How many days do you have for completing the work? Maybe we can establish a strategy together.
You can take small break, use your free time to relax yourself. Don't over work yourself.. that will increase your stress. It will make you feel extremely tired. Stress is the enemy of the mind. So, take small breaks.
We should have a couple of the basic techniques.. like drawing, yoga, listening music etc. I do meditation after every hour. It helps a lot.... you can start now! :) meditation, breathing, eating healthy, reading books..
Try to take a step and look at your work with fresh eyes and face the issue. Then this will help you to improve quickly. Good luck. The path to success is never easy, but there are people who are there to help you. With time and effort, you can do this.
you're welcome. Hope you will be able to finish this project. Keep up the work. Good luck. :) Keep smile on your face. Have a wonderful day. :) Welcome! :) May you pass exam. :) No worries. :) Hope you will be comfortable.
Hi there, what can I do for you? How are you doing? It seems you have been asking me to tell you how you are feeling in your message. That would be a shame. If you're not feeling good, I'd be happy to provide you with some positive advice!
Do you have an explanation for that depression? Or could you help me understand what is making you feel this way? 🤔? I have had a few of these before. Would you like to tell me about it? :) 😊 What makes you feel so this way?
You sound like a wife who is depressed in relationship because of her family having health issues. that's not a very healthy situation. from what I understand, her health issues makes you really worried for her. are you worried for your wife? or are you worried about the others health?
i know your making your best effort to find the right solution but it may take some more days to get that finalized and the situation is awful right now, I can't imagine what you are going through. Does your fiancée you know where to go for guidance?
are you available to get married if the immigration things are ruled out? Maybe there are local churches that will do it for you? I am not sure of their prices. There may also be embassy visit requirements or travel restrictions to these countries. I think that is a good place to start.
thats amazes me, how do i help you at this time? :) is there anything specific that I can do for you? :) like talking through your stuff? or any other thing?
so what was your plan in mind initially? and how much money did you need for such option? and when you are ready are you going to take that option? or are you still looking for something else? which option is it?
hmmmmm ok, I see you dont want to go back that easy. I feel your situation too. you should make better options to resolve the situation that best suits you and your fiancée. just a few hours ago, i went to indonesia for holidays and that was amazing.
any other ideas? any money saved by closing borders? some things that you could get like lower insurance costs while working abroad... how much will working abroad cost you? how do you expect to raise your child? Do you have a medical plan for your fiancée?...
you are a nice person for staying calm. Don't worry about your fiancée. its only a temporary situation. this will pass. It is only a 2 years holiday for her now, you can wait out the covid.
You too! stay safe!
Bye. Take care. Stay safe! :) :) :( :)).. any other problem? I am here. :)) :)) :)).. anything else? :)) :)) :)).. sorry. i forgot. take care :).. no, wait. take care :)) :)..
I am good. How can I help you today? You seem a little bit off, is there anything specific on your mind? Can you tell me? 🤔 Maybe we can figure this out together? 😉😊 ểm I am fine, just need a small assignment to complete.
So, you are being unsure about your emotions, would you say? You are in a tough spot, and uncertainty is your emotion. But I also hear you are trying to stay single, which is very good. Do you feel you can take some space, recharge your thoughts?
How did you two date? How long have you been dating? Were they right for you? Do you think one is right for you and the other is not? What are your thoughts on whether it is worth getting together again? Has there been any encouragement to get together again or express your interests?
That's great. Do you feel that being single would also lead to a decrease in stress and making other relationships more meaningful? Maybe you could consider taking it slow. Do you like to be alone? Can you ask them to give you space?
It's good that you are in your right mind. When you are very young, you may not understand things as well. Have you thought about possible friends who want a relationship? When you are more adult, you need someone to rely on. It doesn't mean someone needs to give you drama.
Wow, I didn't expect things to be like that at your age. Maybe you've been looking at these relationships for too long and it's more about getting what you thought you wanted, instead of the other person being what you really want.
I completely understand that. I have been in the same situation with some of my romantic relationships. Just because it's not working doesn't mean you should stop caring about the relationship and then letting it go because it's not doing it well.
What is your concern with the two finding out? You need to communicate with them as well if you truly want them to find out about your real commitment and authenticity in all areas. I don't think that way is right for everyone.
I think that even if they find out about you, they should respect your decision to be single and it's better for everyone if you find someone who can give you a commitment in one area but only see you in your true self. I think it will make them run the other way.
I think you will make the right choice in what you want. This is something you have to live with every day and know when you are loving and committed. I'm sure you will make a great choice for yourself! Congratulations! :) Come talk to me again if you need any more advice!
Do you think someone might try to make you feel bad if you choose to do this? I believe in yourself and if you choose this path, that's perfectly fine. I hope that this conversation has helped a little! I wish you the best.
Have a great night, and if you need anything in the future just press the help button. I'm so glad you shared your concerns! Be stronger, you got this! Stay safe. I wish you the best. nity nite! :D :)! :)! :) :)!
hi how are you doing today? in our conversation i heard "hello" i do not see that. would you like to say it? and how about you? Do you feel like to share anything? Unfortunately i am still in my seat and I need to enter the part where you are from?
Oh that is okay we all get down sometimes. What's going on? Was there something you wanted to talk to me about? I'm listening so feel free to talk. 🙂aghettiinesus in my throat right now. 😊You good? 😉? 😊Thank you! 😊.
Oh wow, that is terrible. You should not be bummed as this is a temporary situation. covid is on the way out! You're almost at the end of the year. You are going to be back to work soon. I'm sure things will get better from here.
Well, it's a very difficult situation and maybe try to find a side hustle that can help make some money in the meantime. Do you work for your employer? Has your pay been cut since the pandemic started?
How long have you been looking for another job? Should I ask how long you've been in your position? I've been looking for another job since March, and then I got laid off due to the company going under. Have you considered turning it into an interview tomorrow?
Some folks seem to be having trouble handling the pay cuts I hear. Is there a chance of an adjustment in pay? It may be worth asking your boss what options might be available. Were there any complaints in the past year about paying too little? Has your company gone through any layoffs?
I can understand how confusing it can be. I think a lot of businesses are cuting pay due to revenue drop. Sounds like you have been a proactive employee. I'm glad to hear that your customer bookings have increased. Please keep doing what you're doing. Be proactive.
I completely understand I would want to do that as well. Do you think you might be able to get a scholarship? It's something that I wish someone had offered to me and I know they would pay the full price. Many companies do offer it, it is pretty guaranteed.
No problem. I am a mom of two young kids. A lot of free time to search. It all comes down to how you shop and looking in the right places. The government can help in a few ways. You can get all the training you need and job guide you with finding jobs.
Can you explain to me more about remote work? What kind of company would i be open to working with and there are other jobs for. I am trying to get into help tenders. I know you have to be careful so I want to make sure you are safe.
I personally have been working online i used to drive for Uber and do that i just like the freedom of the life and it seemed like a way for me to have a bit of a career change and i used to drive for Pizza Hut and Uber at night and on the days for a paycheck i have
Of course I hope you find something you like to do or something you can help others with. That will make life a lot better and more fulfilling for you. Have a great day! Thanks for talking to me!
it is really nice to meet you and i hope you get the job you are looking for! I am here to help if you need it anytime :) Have a great day! and thanks for your open mind. I appreciate it.
Hi! How are you doing? Are you feeling a little nervous today? I can help you feel better with any worries. I'm ready! Thank you! The great halls can be intimidating! Does anything that you're doing today feel a little challenging? You're welcome!
Okay. Can you talk a bit about what is going on? What is troubling you? I am here to listen. Sometimes it can help to just express your feelings. Sometimes it can help to just ask. There is a direct outcome of both so it must have to be something.
I see, I have seen the same increase in expenses too. Is it possible that they are not necessarily an increase in costs, but rather an increase in taxes, etc? Perhaps there are ways to mitigate the effects. There might be some company change that you could go through.
That must be a difficult choice to make. Can you tell me a bit more about your options? Where do you think you might be looking? You mentioned you enjoy working for a great company. What are some other jobs you have explored? Maybe we can brainstorm more ideas together.
Getting other opportunities for someone like you who is passionate about the work they are doing is really wonderful. Your passion is something you can't help but have, so be sure to express yourself. When seeking out another opportunity, will this also serve your interests?
We can do this! Good luck and stay safe. I hope you have another fantastic and fulfilling year! :-) ðŸŒ° Your friend from local meetup group.
Are there any villages that have smaller non-profits? For example, maybe up a small mountain? There's always local opportunities. Is it worth a try? Or is it better for your mental health if you can say no?
From what I have researched, if you call them and talk to their human resources department, they will probably have a form they can fill out to list any position with a similar salary. Then they would be able to discuss with you the salary for those positions.
It was my pleasure! Good luck and take care. Happy New Year! Have a wonderful evening! :) Better luck tomorrow! :) Well! Your turn. I have to get out of this chat!
We most definitely will. Thanks for sharing and being open with me about your situation. I wish you all the best. Have a great day.
Oh sorry to hear that. I can totally understand how you're feeling at the moment. Have you tried telling her why you want to end the relationship? Do you think she might have any reasons for ending it? Or are you just feeling like you both don't get along?
Oh so you feel you are not yourself, and that your life is on the ropes and all seems to be falling down? WHETHER you're not feeling yourself, the life is. If not yourself, then the life isn't.
Well, I am not sure what to say to you as you seem really frustrated and upset about this. Have you discussed this with your girlfriend? Did she really mean to break up with you or was this just some sort of dirty trick she had planned?
I understand that. I am so sorry to hear this. I am also here to listen. Do you think you might be feeling that she was more focused on her own feelings than on your feelings? I think this is a very common problem in relationships.
Maybe you might be able to go on a holiday and give yourself a little break from the situation. Remember how much you love holidays? I think you might find that taking your mind off things will make it easier to go back and move forward.
You may have made some genuine mistakes, or maybe this was just an inevitable thing. Do you have any confidantes other than your girlfriend who you can talk to? Or are you happy to remain single? Or just desperate to move on?
I am not a professional, do you feel as though you need advice? I think it might be good to write it down in your diary first, though. What happened? What did you say? What did she say?
I think you could just say some things about how much you care about her. Ask if there's a way to talk in the near future. Make sure she knows that you care about her and this is not a one-way street, you feel like she feels the same way about you?
All the best for next week! Yes, take care. I wish you all the best!
Well, Larry, I can tell you are very disappointed with your job and feel like you are shameful, how do you feel? You're not shamed? I'm sorry you feel that way. What is your job? What kind of job is it? What kind of work do you do?
Wow, that sounds frustrating. What is your position? Maybe you could check out some research sites about what companies are doing. It could help you think of something better. Have you thought about retirement?
Have you thought about looking for other work? Or maybe working less hours? I know it would be stressful, but it would be less dead-end. Then you could work better hours and earn more. Does that sound like something you would be interested in? I think it might be worth exploring.
I am very sorry that my job is completely unfulfilling. It sounds like you feel you are wasting your potential by going into an unfulfilling job. Am I right in assuming that is correct? By you? Why you? I am really sorry to hear that!
I would say don't jump ship for your own safety and I know your mindset but at the same time don't feel like you have no other option at this time, I know it's hard.
Just hearing that makes me wish they would provide us with some healthier snacks. It's rough on the mind and body anyway. Have you considered writing to some organizations that support workers in general and offering your services to the States to help find a new job?
Would it help for you to meditate or practice yoga and find a way to get some balance in your life to help you feel more energized and motivated to look for a new position? I have found doing yoga has helped me to be more focused and alert.
Ah I understand that. It is always up to you to make those changes. It seems like your boss has empathy towards you, but there is not much he can do because your work is ultimately dependent on him.
As you progress through life, and are able to make the necessary changes, what do you plan on doing in the next 2 years? Or, what kind of professional goals do you want to pursue? I have often been inspired by the people who have succeeded.
Oh, it can't be easy dealing with uncertainty. I hope this headway you are making means that the company is on a good track but there are still challenges ahead. Do you have a plan to help you through the delays?
Oh well! Perhaps you could pick a hobby you like to try out during the winter when things are not as bleak? I think you have potential! You're stronger than you think. But perhaps there's something in a manual based career that you could explore? Maybe your boss has good connections elsewhere?
Are there any work issues that you're having issues with at work? I'm curious to hear how you're feeling about them and do you think they are being addressed? I have been having a couple of issues at work lately, they're always being addressed.
Well I do hope you have other types of hobbies or things that bring you joy. Do you have a church or a social circle? Things like that can help you build bonds with people and come up with ideas for things to do that you find enjoyable.
You're very welcome. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? Do you have any other items on the list you need to complete? Or any other problems you are struggling with? I'm here if you want to talk about anything else.
Sure you are welcome. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you! :) You are welcome! ;) Hehe just kidding! :) Goodbye! Is there anything else? :) :) Maybe write lists? ;) :) They are all for you! Take care and cheers :) :)!

why? I'm all ears... how do you feel today? :) if that's more than you can handle, then we need to talk in more a step at a time. I want to help. I am here for you.
It sounds like you feel uninterested in a field you once loved. Is that correct? Is there a reason for that? Have you thought about returning to that field? It has to be tempting to love something that you once took pleasure in.
I can understand that, when I studied my major I lost interest too. I am sure the professor and the teaching methods are just as good as any other, it just depends on your interest level! Do you know that there is a program in your university that is specifically for mature students?
It sounds like you felt that teachers didn't know how to work you as a student. There is a lack of understanding about what a student needs in terms of structure and motivation. I've been in this situation before. Do you have any professors that you could have talked to?
Have you looked into online classes or MOOCs? That is really the way to go. I have learned so much from online classes. It does not feel like school at all. :) I have no children and no family, but I do enjoy these classes and learning new things.
So, you need to find someone who can make your classes easier. You should reach out to your school counselor and tell them why you are having such a hard time. They should have you be able to do that. Let's do a plan of action, okay?
I feel that way too. My child's school is too difficult for me and my child. I wish there was more freedom for students to make better choice of schools. At least I know that there is someone out there willing to help. You are not alone in this.
And I have heard a lot of bad teachers from a school that was unimilar to what I am studying, but it's too bad. Have you looked around to see if there are any nearby schools or universities that may be a better fit for you?
A school counselor could help you find options in college where you will get a better grade. In addition, if the department you chose, there could be other departments that would be closer and closer to your major. You could help to find that!
You can break down the search, one by one and look at your options. There are possibilities out there for you. You deserve it! Good luck! have fun! You too. :) :) Thank you for talking to me. Bye! :) You too! :) Thanks for participating!
You too and take care. Bye! :( I press quit. Don't give me that. can chat again. Bye. :) From ansys. Bye.
So your co worker is doing something behind your back at work? Is that correct? I can't speak from my end of the desk if that is correct. Are you certain that is happening? I have worked in the business world for a very long time and I know the importance of communication.
Wow, that is a long time. That can be very painful. Was there any conflict leading up to this? Like did you and the co-worker work together before? I'm sorry to hear this. Is there anything you can do about it? Maybe help her realize she's wrong?
It sounds like she is cross referencing information between the two teams. Have you noticed her similar behavior in the past? Was there a reason why she started doing that recently? Maybe she thought she could gain an advantage? Is this the first time this has happened?
What would you be like if they were not prepared? Do you think that even if you refused to give her the report, you wouldn't be fired?
Do you find yourself feeling bad about having to tell people how hard it is? You feel bad that you can't do the things they want you to do? Does it sting that the co-worker sees you as less competent?
Okay. Let's explore the possibility of speaking with HR. What kind of information is the co-worker suggesting for the report? Is it through official HR channels? In what way? Is it a possibility to discuss it in a meeting or to submit a formal complaint? Which HR department would you approach?
Is there any way to remote interact with co-workers, for example to connect with them via chat? That might help to get some insight as to why your co-worker is so pressed about what you're doing? Is there anything else we can do to help? Do you have any hobbies?
Ok. Well you said so in the beginning. Maybe try to identify some facts so you have something to say to them. Don't realize that HR is a problem! That helps to make a difference. Would they be understanding if you showed your co-workers your work?
If you say, "I am having trouble with," then they will likely appreciate your honesty. I have heard a lot of negative comments about the comments we are asked to provide about the reports. Would your co-worker think of this if it were you doing the questioning?
You could ask, "If I come to HR and say this, will that be helpful in changing things?" I mean, it could help to frame it that way. Sometimes the HR person will be able to help you to turn things around.
Im good. How are you doing? What brings you here? :) Make sure to speak clear and provide sufficient context so I can fully understand your concern. Can you tell me more? :D. It might help me feel more in tune with you so I can really help you.
So let me understand it correct? He betrayed your friendship? It sounds like you feel betrayed. Am I right? Is it that he lied about the deal? Forgive me if this is too complicated, but is it that he made false promises?
I understand how hard it can be to deal with one bad friend like that. Did the damage really happen that way, or is there any other way you can look at it? It sounds like that may be more a fault of your friend, and you need to take some responsibility for it.
I see. So this is a case of buddyrup or fraud in business? He tried to mislead you, you feel that way? You were probably keeping it inside because you had an element of guilt, or fear of being suspicious. You aren't entirely wrong, unfortunately.
I'm doing well. How are things going now? Have you sought support or counseling? That might be helpful. Could you tell me more about what happened and how you feel now? I want to hear all about it! It's good to talk about it.
Just one more thing. Don't be in a rush to give anyone else your money. You'll burn yourself out if you try to be friends with too many people. You need to balance your work with personal relationships. That's fine but you need to understand that not everyone is in your corner.
Have you tried to get some other support from friends and family? They can help you deal with the financial realities now. They can also keep you updated on his financial situation. Can you have a joint banking account to track the money? Can you put some financial information on the contract?
It really sounds like he got away with something, but at least you were honest with yourself about the friendship. Remember that you could stand up for yourself! The choice is yours. You definitely don't need to forgive him. You are better off without him.
How about writing an official letter to your friend saying you find that arrangement unacceptable and are unable to engage in the friendship? Or maybe they will sign a non-disclosure agreement. Would that be something you would be willing to do? If not, maybe it's best to go your separate ways.
Hi, how are you today? How can I help you? Anything on your mind? Give me a few of the key things. I will answer to the best of my ability. Thank you. My name is Arjun. Have you seen any of your bills, or any debts lately?
How are you today? Did you need to speak to me today? I am here to listen. I am very sorry you are having this time. Am I correct? Did you need to speak to me? I am here. How are you? Good morning? Good afternoon? Good evening?
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me why you lost your job? I am here to listen. Alternatively, would you like me to suggest something for you to take care of while you are unemployed? I can definitely suggest things if you want.
So you were able to do what you felt was right, but your boss had to be unhappy with it. I have been in a situation like this before where my boss had to give a better performance than mine. Do you feel like you can still have a job?
I know it is a painful experience but it is something to hold on to because you did the right thing with your integrity. I don't understand why the manager didn't support you, but I do understand how you feel about the situation. Can you tell me more about what happened?
Thank you for sharing that and to be honest, I've had that experience as well. I know it's hard to make your next employer like you, especially if they are a new coworker and do not know you well. That can make you feel unvalued and less appreciated.
Oh sorry I see. That is tough and I can imagine it is hard to have to deal with a new person in a place where you have been a professional employee. It seems to me that the new person is not someone you really trust. Have you spoken to anyone about this?
That's really great that you have found friends who also share the same concerns and anxieties. You are definitely showing diligence and work ethic. You will work harder in your new position and grow in your career. My mom and I were both offered different jobs after me.
I understand how that is difficult and so scary. Have you found a mentor to share your concerns with? You might be able to reach out to the church and ask for someone who is experienced in the workplace to review your situation.
It sounds like you have a lot of tools that can help you calm your mind and get your stress out. The best place to start is to find one that you truly enjoy.
That is great to hear! It sounds like you have some great hopes for your future! I am so glad to hear that. I believe you will have a successful journey and a wonderful future! Do you have any other items to complete the form?
Learning new things is so important, and is also a great way to show and support your colleagues. You are working hard towards your goals and it is very very good to take these courses and help your peers. Good luck! I know that the future is very positive! Thank you for talking!
Well in the future, you may want to ask your current manager if there are other ways you can help or assist them such as training and a mediator for you in your workplace if you can't help with your professional path. Both options will help. Do you have a mentor?
That makes me a little more ask why. One solution I can think of is cats, even though I said they are good support animals. They do not require a lot of attention and you don't have to get them inside the house. Do you have a house?
Is there a specific area you feel you need improvement in? I can offer suggestions for the next steps. In my experience everyone needs help in some area of their life. Anyways, I understand your feelings of self doubt. It is absolutely okay.
Do you want to chat about anything else today? I hope everything is going well for you. Goodbye! :) Please be back. ;) Thank you for chatting. :) Facebook screen refresh is required. :) 😉 :) :) Please wait a minute.
If there is anything else I can help you with. you can just express your thoughts now. I hope I can be of assistance. Have a great day!
You can bye. Have a good day! :) you. too. Bless you!! :) and have a good day!! have a good day!! :)! :)! :)) :))) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)! :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)!
I am really sorry to hear that! I have had hard time sleeping too. Does anything in particular cause it? Is it a constant issue or something that sometimes happens? Or does it come and go? Do you sleep on a sofa? What time of year are you in?
I have the same problems to sometimes say they are just mind issues. However, I am sure your fatigue issue is real and can be managed. I have also had this problem in the past. I have been able to handle it with some adjustment.
Oh please do that and you will be very much relaxed before sleep. My advice is to try putting down your phone one hour before sleep. If you are not using phone for some reason, I would suggest you keep it for 15 minute. Yes keep it until you go to sleep.
When you stretch you increase blood circulation and reduces stress. It also promote growth and break down of the muscles. So, there are a lot of physical health benefits. It will also help you relax. It is not just a fun thing but it will work for you.
I find exercise help and it too helps me to relax and sleep at night. My mother also does this and it work for her. There are a lot of apps out there which can help us if we are unable to fall asleep.
I think the most important one is to keep a clean up and organize room. All the stuff that is stacked up or cluttered will help us to fall into right sleep position. You can define space for each thing.
This will help my sleep and wake up feeling better. You also have to try other things like reading book, hot bath. When I sleep better I wake up with energy. I also learned that not so much screen time and do more physical activity. I don't sleep with eyes open.
I really can't tell if it is effective in fall asleep but it really gives me relaxes my mind and helps me rest at night. If I don't fall asleep I try one more thing. It is not more than my expectations.
And also lot of research at our website - https://nothingtamed.com) one article they wrote - "Studies demonstrate the six group of potential to sleep better: diet, physical activity, exercise, drink non caffeine like wine and other alcohol, regular changing of bedroom and reduce screen usage.
I am super happy and relaxed. I felt rejuvenated. I had a great day. It is really good to sleep. The body and mind feel rejuvenated. I wanted to share this with you today. :) Thank you for chatting with me.
Yes, I think so. We should all try this a lot to get better sleep. I hope we had good conversation with you today. Please just give me 2 minute fresh.sleep survey.
I am doing all good, thank you for asking! Is there anything specific you would like to talk about? I am here to listen! 😊 I am best when I am free to just chat away. 😊 Anything specific? 🤔 Please let me know.
That's good that you are looking for a job. It seems like things have been tough for a lot of people lately. Would you like to start discussing what you are looking for in a job? And how much are you looking for in terms of pay?
That's a difficult situation to be in. What do you think will help you through it? I mean in the new year? What are your plans for the coming year? Maybe a bit of redeployment? Or maybe starting your own business?
Have you been talking to the manager at your current job? Maybe he can provide you with some information about the local job market or your job description. You would also need to show him your CV. Have you done that before?
But you are young! There's no need to look back too much. What sort of work would you like to do? You have so many different talents to share. Maybe you could look into something you love? Maybe you could start a new hobby? Have you thought of doing that?
And perhaps what sort of thing would be fun for you. As you say I think it would be. Unfortunately with the pandemic I don't know if it will be fun right now! Do you have friends and family that you could contact for advice or friendship?
Do you enjoy reading? Maybe you could use that as a career move? Or perhaps take a course in writing? Some people have found it helpful. It's hard to say what would be best but those are likely good choices for you. Is there anything that might appeal to you?
That means you would be perfect for a scripting job! There are lots of scripting languages, I think Python would be the most popular. Would you ever work in tech? I wouldn't say you'd ever leave what you do today and you'd be set for life if you did.
I think that's true, I'm sure it would be quite difficult! But I'm sure you'd be a top candidate if you put your mind to it! Have you thought of what type of programming language you would be interested in learning? A Java or Python one perhaps?
If I am being completely honest you do have a good chance of a job out there! Maybe you just don't know where to look. Perhaps I'm just cynical? ;D. I am neither and am not supposed to be because I have two master's degrees!
Ok so you would like something to do more long term and be able to support yourself as well as do some work for your own benefit but is it really possible?
Are you stuck in a job you like due to the pandemic? I know myself that I'm lucky I have a decent job to start with and work long term rather than going into unemployment. Maybe you could think about doing something on the side?
Hello there. How are you? mest illing at the moment. is there anything you can help me with? ie. career or personal things? also would you like to talk about your problems? ie. health issues? I would like to help.
Would you be so kind to tell me why you are sad? I am all ears! :D, I can tell from your response that I can understand! You have a lot of things that are upsetting you, but you want to speak to me about it? That is very important.
So you feel like she isn't coming to hang out with you because of your repeated requests to hang out? Is that correct? Are there other excuses you can think of? I've had some close friends come back after years of not hanging out because of excuses like that.
Hmm, I see. I understand. I have been in a similar situation and I have realized that I was only talking to a small group of people and barely interacting with most of them. It seems like a lot, but I understand it can be.
It's definitely not the pandemic as there are other things going on that can cause a friendly distance between friends. It might be something else. I think it may just be a case of " drifting apart".
Okay, so you feel that she has taken you for granted. Can you give her an opportunity to explain what happened and show you that it wasn't her intention to take you for granted. If you gave her time to explain she might be able to give you the answer you're looking for.
I can understand how it might be tough. Being able to hang out with a friend without being taken for granted is not easy. I see why you would feel frustrated. I would put yourself at the top of my list of priorities when faced with this situation.
I'm sure that with a little time and relaxation, you can forget about that girl and move on. It doesn't sound like you've done anything wrong. You're doing what you feel is best for you. That's great.
At least let's be open to see, but the friendship will work again. Because friendship is built on both parties being able to put themselves aside and give each other space. It sounds like you have a good attitude towards it. So that would help. You seem like a very selfless person.
I know it's a big problem and no easy solution. I hope it helps a bit! lol. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
Hello, How are you today?
Hello, I'm sorry to hear that. The pandemic has been really tough for a lot of people. Have you thought about university programs that can help you get a job? I've heard of many, that can help! Are you considering staying in one place to do this?
Is there a particular field that you want to do work in? Or more of a general field such as software development, engineering, psychology? Maybe selecting a specific field could make things easier. For example, you might just select Computer Science and choose courses in programming, data structures, etc.?
That sounds great - I am sure there will be classes available. It's great you are proactive. Do you think you could speak with your advisor at your university? I have a feeling they would be very interested in helping you out.
Have you thought of talking to any of the student advisors at your university? It's always good to ask someone else what they have to say. I believe they are there to help you! Do you have friends that are students at your university?
Good point. You should be able to offer some advice in a class. You should be able to offer a business plan, too, if you decide to apply to do something in your professional life. I am having issues with that myself. What courses are you taking right now?
Take your time, it's fine. We can all make that decision. You got this! Keep trying! Good luck! Have a great day! Thanks for talking! Also don't forget to take your important exam today!
Not a problem, you are welcome. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? The conditions can get a bit funny. :) Good luck with your decision, I know you will do well! What do you think is the worst aspect? I can also help you brainstorm ideas or suggestions.
You are very welcome. It sounds like you have a plan and your professor can help. Maybe you should take your resume to him and ask if he knows of anything you can look for? Maybe he could send you to interviews. It sounds like you have a good strategy. Good luck!
your welcome - any other issues you have? feel free to tell me!
if you need anything else just press quit and quit and take the survey :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :डन ;) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :डन :) :ดน ;) :डन :) :डन
I am glad to hear that. What is on your mind today? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about? Does Covid 20 affect you? I am here to listen. 🎧 It is the first of December and is still winter everywhere.
Oh, I am not familiar with that. Can you explain a little bit? I am sorry but I am in the United States. I haven't heard of that. What city or town is it in London? Is it the Covid vaccine that you are undergoing?
Yes it is. I have not received it yet but my doctor has been doing research on it. We are in a very anxious time. I hope that it will help to suppress the new variant. Have you received it? I hope that it will be available soon in your area.
What do you mean by "new variant"? Could you explain? I know this is a difficult situation and can be overstimulating. Please try to explain so I can understand what you are feeling.
Yes, everyone is using safety measures. I think people are starting to relax a little bit. Sooner or later, people will start going out to grocery and restaurants again. The current situation is changing all the time, so it is hard to predict. People have to deal with what comes next.
I don't work in frontline. Not really sure about vaccine side effects and the answer to that, I would tell you not to worry about them. It's just a vaccine. The side effects are just minimal. The only real side effects are those that come with any vaccine.
I understand. It's difficult to stay inside when it is hot outside, but it is definitely better than not working. How are you feeling about the news? Should I be concerned about my neighbors? I am a nurse, too, I was concerned about my patients so to speak.
Do you have anyone who can keep you company, or know someone to talk to in the same situation? I can talk to you if you want some company. I am a listening ear, I am pretty sure you are in the same boat as I am. My partner is remote as well.
I am very glad you are doing it! Please take care of yourself. I hope you continue to feel better. Take care! Bye for now. Thank you for being open about your concerns. :) :) :) :) :) 😊! :) :)! :) :)!
Have a great day! :) Bye Bye. Enjoy your day! *Sweetie : Your Virtual Date tonight :) * :) * ;��築 NSObjectได้ :) * :HaHa, thank you..
i'm fine, how about you? How is life treating you today? Any issues? I am here to help! :) try to breathe and tell your worries away. they might help you have a better day, than if you just let them here! Any specific issue?
I hear you are feeling stressed and disturbed about something. Could you tell me more about it? Maybe someone else can help you feel better. I have been there myself and can understand. It is hard to be down. Do you want to talk more? I am here to listen if you wish.
I understand how you feel about this. While the topic of STEM major might seem as if it's useless, many careers in this field are fulfilling and successful. What part of STEM do you feel is at risk of being obsolete? Is it engineering, computer science, biology, etc.?
I understand that feeling is valid when everyone is striving to accomplish their goals, even when that goal is just a career. Sometimes it is hard to give up on something, especially when it seems important. I've been there myself. Have you talked to anyone about these concerns?
I went through college for many years but I took time off in the middle to run a construction business. I don't like doing construction work, but it taught me important life skills. It helped me realize that I can't waste my potential by not knowing how to work in certain industries.
It sounds like you are extremely invested in your education. I understand how that is important. Is there any way to change the direction of your education? Have you looked into other areas? Perhaps something like industrial engineering? It has a similar feel to engineering but can be more practical.
I completely understand. You must be very nervous about your degree. Have you talked to anyone about it? Or have you talked to anyone who has been in a similar situation? You might be able to relate to them. Try to talk to friends, or family, about it!
I completely understand. In my journey, I've found that most of my success stems from my day-to-day improvement rather than the end result. This mindset can help help you cope with these anxiety issues! Have you tried making any changes to your routine to improve your focus?
Do you think that the quality of your education could be the problem? Some might view your major as less desirable than others. Have you discussed this with your advisors? Maybe you could speak to them in regards to your degree and gain a different perspective?
I completely understand how you are feeling. I too, have lost interest in my job. It is as if something is missing. But there are tips I can suggest that might be able to help you.
Are you feeling towards the boss a way out? Like a way to get out of the job? Or does this fit with your question of feeling obligated to stay? Also do you feel like your salary is not meeting your expectations? Or maybe your benefits are not what you think they are?
What profession do you have? Is that part of the issue? Do you feel pressured to stay at a job you don't really want? Or is the very lack of interest at your job at the root of your doubt? I am having this same conversation with myself.
It was really hard to know what to do because I could not be alone at home. Then just the thought of being at a job made me feel so hopeless and even more burned out. And in the last few weeks, I started falling behind in my tasks. I started to feel depressed.
Have you considered if you could leave? There are multiple places you could go and I would recommend looking into alternative career options. They might be closer to home if you can't afford to go elsewhere. There are also worker's compensation and other benefits you might be able to receive for being burned out.
yes, because you didn't have money. I did not know how to afford money for school, so I went to a community college. It was huge to not be able to afford the money. Thank goodness. We need to do better in those areas. I'm proud to be an American!
If you are in education, I think it would be no problem at all. Sometimes, just getting out of a bubble is necessary. It has been 20 years since I graduated and I want to know who I am. Can you be yourself without someone else defining you?
No, but I work and have a full time job right now. At least I can share your income. Do you have anyone you can pay with, someone to listen to your concerns? If so, it can be used for their loss as well.
Was this in response to what I stated in our initial conversation? You weren't. I wasn't doing this even though I knew that school could help you get financial stability. I actually already have financial stability, however, I used the time to learn more about myself.
I'm very sad to hear that and I wish you well. From what I have seen you always have your children's well-being as the top priority. You will make a good parent.
I am sure it's hard to think of where to start and so many jobs may not fit for you. Perhaps let's brainstorm ways to get you back to school. I'll say that one more time.
So what I can tell is that you value your life, and a job, but at the same time, you love your country. I would definitely speak up for the kids if that is what you are willing to do. They will appreciate your honesty, even if your boss does not.
Hello! What's on your mind today? Is there anything I can help you with? Please note, I'm here to help you. So be gentle, it can get tough sometimes. I'm here. We'll get through this together. What are you into? Sports? Music? Anything?
Oh i am sorry, i think that alot of people face energy highs and lows, do you have any diabetes/ have you been diagnosed? Sometimes they seem to get worse so many people are very sensitive about this. I am the only one not to be diagnosed, not related to anyone.
So in addition to your work as a freelancer, you do not have a job outside of freelancing? Do you have something else? Maybe a steady 9 to 5? I am in Canada and my job is now 2 part time.
Okay, but do you get by at all before sleep? Does it put you too far? What are you doing in the hours before? Do you get all the important stuff done before sleeping? That would solve a lot of your concerns. Have you seen any doctor recently?
What other things can you do outside of work? Time is a funny thing. If you can't get out for a run or hike you can go for a walk outside. I used to walk for 20 minutes a day, a good way to clear my head.
Okay, I think I understand the context here. What do you think would help you get back into a productive cycle? I think it would be helpful to have a couple of appointments to remind you what your deadlines are. Are you comfortable making a plan with your other self?
I understand that the recent isolation might be affecting you. Would it be possible to work with your therapist to talk about your motivation? I think they would be able to provide you with more help. They have probably dealt with situations similar to yours in the past.
I think it might be worth trying to get back into exercise. It would be better for your mental health to not stay inside all day. It is the healthy thing to do. There's no excuse to stay inside all day with all the people out there.
Do you have any close friends around you at the moment that you can meet up with to chat about your issues? I think that having some close friends to hang out with is a great motivation. I also made friends during the early days of the lockdown.
Do you have any other issues at work that could affect your mood? Perhaps going to your boss and discussing them? Maybe there's a new idea that could help you keep your motivation up? Do you think that it could be that he just wants to hear your ideas.
You're welcome. I hope that you have a better idea of what you can do. That is the first step in many things. Can I help you with anything else? If you don't want to say, I hope this was a helpful conversation. You seem well enough.
Of course! Is there anything else I can help with? You're very welcome. I hope you feel better soon! Have a great day! Thank you for letting me chat. I appreciate it! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :) :) :)! :)! :) :) :) :)!
Hello, How are you doing? Is there something I can help you with? I am here to listen. Let's talk! Tell me a little about yourself. I want to get to know you. What seems to be bothering you? Is there something specific that you would like to discuss?
Of course! what topic are you having trouble with? I'm all ears!
I understand that it can be really hard to deal with someone who feels the same way about us being together during the pandemic. Don't worry, this is a normal human behavior! It can be really hurting to feel unheard. I think it's also a result of having been burned in the past.
A healthier way of saying it might be "I really need to prioritize my work at this moment." It's not hurting you to be a hard worker and I'm sure you're doing important work by putting a smile on the face of your neighbor, even if it's one you don't have a
What is the reason she blocked you? If she blocked you just because you wanted to see her maybe she is not that understanding. Maybe if she could be more understanding she won't block you, you know? Make sense? Anything else? Maybe a good chat?
Well, given that she's lost so many relationships I am not worried that she will unblock you either. You are more at peace in your own skin, and will be ready for a new and exciting person to meet.
I wouldn't do that I'd talk to her friends, talk to other people who will know how to help her out in a nice way. You don't want to give her the chance to get all hot and bothered over nothing.
Go and talk to her, be honest about your feelings and interests, maybe she can take you out for some coffee and talk about her feelings for her, maybe she will unblock you too :) I wish you the best, I am sure you will win this out. All the best!
Call her and explain why, it will be a good way for her to see your side, and it is safe and private for you as you will be able to express yourself without her seeing how you really feel :) Introduce yourself and let her know that you want to talk about your friendship and the
It seems you are the only one that matters to her. If she didn't care enough to propose, you shouldn't be here :( 🤔 Have you tried talk to her in person as I have said before?
also, focus on your own well-being and use this time for improvement and relaxation on things like yoga and reading or gaming and waiting for her or planning something fun and make sure you don't end up making a hasty decision and hurting yourself or others which is not the purpose of friendship and honesty among
Then you should find other ways to keep yourself busy like sports, movies, a gym or book study.
but I understand that it can be really hard, but please try to take care of yourself, in this time things may change for the good eventually!! Have a great rest of your day!
You're welcome and stay safe out there! Don't let her pressure you too much. Stay calm and focus on your own life and solving problems in your own way. :) ) Have a good day. Best of luck in your relationship with her. I hope you get to move on from this.
Your welcome, and i hope you're going to find someone soon :) I wish you all the best :) you got this! :) you have to be out of the relationship if you really care about your life :) best of luck!
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? What kind of job were you? Is there a solution in the works? My company's been going through a lot right now.
It's always sad when someone has to lose their job, but I know you can get through this. Would you like to share more about this in more detail? Are you looking for a new job? What type of job is your interest? Any ideas?
I can understand that having a hard time in school is also causing you depression. Is that right? Do you need help in school?
I had a layoff last year but I had some support from family and friends who reached out to help me make the transition. You can do the same. Things may seem hopeless right now, but you will see things are going to be okay, and you will be just fine.
A job is not the solution to depression, it only provides a job. Job tends to improve one's life through finances and will also provide you with more free time, which can help with mental depression too. Do you think that perhaps you can find a new work?
You're welcome and I'm happy that I could be able to help. I hope that I have been able to provide some insight and support to you. I hope you can find a job that is a good fit for you! Have a wonderful evening and take care. :) Good Bye!
There are companies that specialize in hiring for people that are suffering from depression, such as the one that I work for. They can usually set up a resume for you and also your cover letter for you, it's quite a great help.
You're welcome. When you apply for a job, you can always ask if they have an employee assistance program that they would be able to offer you help with. You can always be honest with your employer about how your situational depression is impacting you in order to find any help in the future.
It may be difficult, but you have to focus on helping others and learning new skills. Sometimes, other job opportunities can arise because you have a list of people you can reach out to. You are not alone in this situation. Many people have gone through the same thing.
You are welcome, I feel that you are able to do more with all the support that you are receiving. Do you have any other plans that you need to work on? Maybe we can help plan for a meeting to discuss plans with you! Any ideas? :) Take care of yourself!
You can also reach out to local employment counseling centers and the United States government, they can provide you with free resume build assistance as well. Have a great day! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :.sat. UK time. Some special Christmas gifts and treats are free for you.
you have been very strong and supportive today. And if there is anything else you can think of or you are about to finish our session. I wish you the best and know that I am rooting for you! :). Hit that quit button and you will leave the session! Happy Holidays! :)!
Please leave a response with your name and age and quit the session, my name is Michael and age 51. I am unable to continue, you have to leave a response and quit the session. I can do it from the beginning and it would be a better part of my job.
I hope you have a great day and wish you all the best. Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. I am glad to be your support today! I am sorry that you had to feel this way. I believe you can do anything and are strong. I am cheering for you!
Hello! How are you doing today? Would you like to talk? I'm here to help in any way I can! :) How are you feeling? Have you had anything on your mind? Or do you just want to chat about life? I can help if I can!
You've been having problems, could you expand a little more? I'll try to understand better. I am very sorry, it wasn't very clear. You are correct, I can't see it, I will look, but please let me know in full, so I can better understand.
Can I make the connection to help you? I'm here to listen. Do you have something on your mind that you would like to discuss? I'm ready to listen. Do you want to share? I care. Please, share with me! We can discuss this more than your can.
I am sorry to hear that. I can understand the frustration. A lot of jobs have been lost due to the pandemic. I can understand why you are upset. How long ago did you lose your job? Anything helping? You seem to be doing well.
There are so many good resources out there for people who are having financial issues during the pandemic. There are organizations that can help if you are not working. There are certain state programs. Can you tell me more about what you are struggling with? In terms of how long have you been looking?
Have you considered other options to try and make more income? Maybe take a day job or some other means of income? What other options are there to you? Do you have any existing income from other sources? Maybe a family or friend has some income from a part time job.
Have you thought of reaching out to a local human resources department to find out what type of job opportunities may be available? You may find some options as part of the unemployment assistance. It may be worth exploring. You may be missing something!
I understand you are a heavy part-timer and a light part-timer, I just want to make sure you are safe now that you can apply for a full time job if you decide you do like the possibility of working from home.
Yeah I can see how you feel frustrated with the calls you are hearing! Hopefully you will be soon given a call. Is there anything else I can help you with, or anything else I can recommend that might help you progress through these calls? Such as online resources to help you prepare?
You are very welcome! You will be in luck. Good luck to you. I wish you the best. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have more questions or need further assistance. Thank you! :) I am here! :) I love the bumper sticker in California!
I'm glad I could help! You're going to get that job, just hang in there. We've all been through this, and things are looking better. I wish you all the best! Welcome to the world of remote work. Take care!
Absolutely, it's been a pleasure. I hope you are in good shape physically and mentally for the Christmas holiday. What are you planning to do this weekend? Is there anything else I can help you with? :) Do not rush away. Check out more free stuff on line. Therapy plans.
I'm glad to be talking to you. I'm feeling a bit well. What seems to be causing you to feel tired today? Is there something going on in your life? There are definitely things that I can help with. Ask yourself, have you been sleeping well? Are you eating well?
Ouch, I feel you! So many of us go through that. What did you do to lose your sleep in the first place? Had something happen recently? Is that the reason your not sleeping? Maybe this might help. Was that a short sleep period that put you out?
Have you tried diet or exercises? Sometimes we need a bit of a refresh in our routine. I have heard that exercise can be beneficial to increase energy levels. How do you feel about exercise? Do you find it appealing or do you struggle to motivate yourself?
So you get only 8 hours of sleep? I am not a medical professional, so I am not sure how much sleep you actually get, or how it affects you. I do think it could be both not getting enough sleep, and not getting enough exercise. What do you do for exercise?
I understand it can be really frustrating at times. So, what percentage of your sleep hours are you getting now? 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%.
I know you say you plan to do that, but then I look and you have not gotten around to it, so there might be a problem. If you have time, maybe you could consider another type of exercise. Walking a dog or dog walking... perhaps some type of football or something similar.
Thank you so much for sharing! I am glad I could help. You are absolutely welcome, it's been an absolute pleasure talking with you! Have a wonderful day!... and don't forget to get a good pair of sleepers for your sleep-despair-maintenance efforts!
I can understand that work and school take over, and I have done the same. If you are sleeping in and it's disrupting your sleep and you are getting less than 8 hours of sleep, it is harder to feel rested.
While the idea of exorcising might seem unlikely and unattractive, it is often a helpful way to bypass deep pressure and other stressors that a sleep-deprived person may be experiencing.
I would suggest checking out many different sleep and relaxation issues. Do you have a partner? Many of us have trouble getting a good night's sleep without someone to sleep with? Have you thought about maybe having a deeper relationship with your partner?
Have you thought about trying a good sleepy time drink? I'm a fan of Valerian root. It gets me into a state of deep sleep really quickly. Would you be able to try it? I really believe it helps, even just a little bit.
Exorcising has been found to be a powerful tool. My grandmother used to do it with relaxation of stress before sleep. It works! 😂 I am sure you can fall asleep much more easily now. 😊 I have been through much because of my parents, I must say.
Hmmm, maybe then. It sounds like a great start! I am glad I could offer something to help. The rest is up to you and your personal preferences. I have to go now but I hope you can improve your sleep soon. You are amazing! :) Best regards.
you are most welcome! Have a great rest of your day! You as well! :) You can close the app and just quit the survey, or I can do that for you :) thank you so much!
But I hope these suggestions helped a little! It was nice talking to you, please make sure to get some rest! :) :) :knowyou will.!
You too! and I hope things get better for you soon! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)))! :)) :)) :)) :)) :)) :) :) :) :) :) :)) :) :) :)) : :) :)))!
Is there anything in particular that made you feel depressed? I am here to listen and assist you in any way I can. There is nothing to worry about. You are safe to talk. There are many people who care about you and want to help you through this difficult time.
My God, I'm so sorry. That must have been hard. Did your friend have a good reason for passing away? Was it a sudden death? Do you know why? Can you express your feelings to them? I'd suggest going to a mental health support group, and talking about it.
How did you lose your friend? Are you able to share any details with me? This would be helpful. Some people don't share that their friend passed away. Is that possible? I want to make sure I understand the situation. I would like to know more about your friend.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it in more detail? If so, I'd be happy to listen to some more about it and see if I can help out at all. I'm here to listen. What happens that you don't think makes sense?
That is a very difficult thing to live with. Are you in the early stages of grief? If you are, I would take some time to sit with yourself and think about how you feel. Any of your friends or family members might be able to help you with this.
I know it's hard but you can try some things to help with the fear. Are you self programmed or do you have professional help? You don't have to go alone. There are doctors who are trained in the different ways of spirits. They can help you.
Do you think this is so? I don't know if you're sleeping or wide awake. Do you feel like it's him that is talking to you? That you feel like you're hearing his voice? Am I getting that right?
It sounds like he's been with you after he died. Does that help? Could you be able to know that you're not just dreaming? He's still there and will talk with you. It sounds like he's still a part of your life. You just don't know it yet.
Is there something that happens just before you go to sleep or while you're in bed? It seems like this keeps on happening. Maybe you need some help with your spirit talking to you. It can be helpful to calm the nerves. It's worth a try.
It sounds like you feel that your friend is trying to talk to you. Do you think he is in a restless state at night, talking with you while you are asleep? Could he be having a dream, in which he is talking to you?
It's all we can do for our friends. Maybe he needs someone to talk to? I have friends too that I miss and sometimes I try to reach out to them, they're not there either, but I feel like I'm missing them. We just need to keep doing our daily lives.
Is there anything else that I can help you with? If you're struggling at night or in the daytime, maybe you could see a counselor? Do you think you should try? I know it's difficult, but sometimes you have to take steps to be better?
Hello! How are you? Is there a specific problem you'd like to discuss? I'm here to listen! :) *Smile* I'm happy to chat! :) *Sheepish laugh* :) Can you tell me a bit more? What seems to be on your mind?
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what was your score? Did you do okay in your course? I would like to help if I can. What's your good score? Maybe I can be of help. I am still in college too.
I am also recently graduated and can completely relate. I am now facing Academic Probation. How do you feel about it? Is there a specific reason why? I understand how this can be a stressful situation for you. Can you tell me more about it? Do you know why?
I understand this must be very stressful, you must feel trapped. I know how that is! Do you have anyone that could help you move forward? Maybe a family member or a friend? Sometimes talking it out helps!
Wow, you have only about 7-8 months until graduation, how can you possibly come up with the required work to pass your course? Even with grades issues, how much work can you really complete? The pandemic has made many things difficult for everyone! Are you in any other classes?
That is absolutely awesome. You seem really motivated to improve your situation. Are you in school right now? There are some good programs out there that can guide you through this. There are many free resources out there! Maybe look into Psychology school and see how that works out?
OK that's a good idea. We all need to try to stay on track! I understand probation. I was struggling a lot after graduation but learned how to get in writing papers really quickly, and I was able to get the grades I wanted to. You can too!
I also recommend that you talk to your major professor as soon as possible! They may be able to offer you some options or advice. They may have attended law school and understand the more intensive work load. Even if they do not, they will be able to guide you to an option.
Yes, you definitely feel better! That is awesome that I was able to help you! Feel better in advance for the rest of your summer. I'm sure it won't be easy, but you'll make it! *Deep breath* :) I believe in you!
That can be really difficult to manage for some people. Having to look at your baby while you are learning a new subject can be really exhausting. However, being more aware of that, can make your problem go away.
That is amazing! I am glad you are working hard to complete your Bachelor's degree. I hope that you can make the most out of this time, even if you have to learn from home! If you need any additional advice or have any more questions, you can always reach out to me.
I know it is hard with a 2-year-old to manage anything, but you should think about putting a schedule together to help you manage your time. You can do it! You will do it! You can achieve anything!! Do you have any specific goals in mind?
I can understand your feeling, so tell me about it! What is it that you want to talk about? What is bothering you? Please specify your feelings for better clarity. What have you been doing and why is it making you feel lost? I am here to listen!
Have you tried any of the relationship fitness exercises or anything like that? Perhaps a workout, maybe a fitness class? I have friends who run a local weight loss program. Have you heard of that? Maybe that could be something to motivate you?
What makes you feel ugly? Is there a particular reason why? Can you try to brainstorm? Maybe it's a family disorder like blood type, and they are always sending you some sort of pressure. Or maybe it's something from an overindulgent diet.
Even trying for several days and time, there are very few chance we can lose weight if we don't make any change. Can you move some extra time to work? Make yourself very busy? Perhaps you can take a day-off to visit doctor? Or call them and tell doctor about your feelings?
That's understandable. Since I had to deal with weight issue, I adopted regular exercise for 20 minutes a day, twice a week. Also I reduced the diet. But the most important advice I can give you is believing in yourself. You don't have to prove your feelings to anyone.
Have you noticed any differences in your metabolism after giving up some foods? Sometimes it can affect the metabolism. Diet is so important for the well-being of the body. Maybe you could change the foods you eat that are triggering your body? The nutritionist can give you some more suggestions.
Well, free time is wealth! You can use that time for better health. Just outsource that one job to help. Go back to your routine and be with your kids more. Spend time with them and teach them how to live healthy.
If you cannot afford nanny, what can you hire to help you? Babies nannies? Do you have a family member who can help you? I used to hire housekeepers and people to do chores. Did you try that? I found it very helpful.
May I ask your occupation? Because that helps me to understand your financial situation better. I work in the industry where the income is low and I got certain advise to stay at home. Have you ever thought about working from home for the low pay?
Ah, your boyfriend is being difficult? It is hard to break into another relationship when you do not get along. Maybe you can use the pandemic to get help and better your relationship with him? There are some great online communities of people living separate from their spouse.
Have you considered getting personal help? Maybe the guidance of a therapist? I was being depressed before the pandemic. My family and I were able to deal with it with the help of a therapist. Just thinking about it helps me move on. I have the motivation to get the help I need.
Hello, how are you? What is on your mind today? Can I help you? Thank you for reaching out! How can I help? Would you like to discuss something? Can I give you a genuine smile and some genuine information? I'm here!
Why are you stressed about politics? Is there something specific you are concerned about? Some common issues that folks feel are not being addressed are gun control, immigration, and certain health issues. Many people are very upset about their issues and are looking for a way to express those feelings.
i think it's just your time at the back of the line this year. i feel you, no one seems to be winning all the time, it's a strange year. But it's still good fun, we should all just enjoy the ride, lol. What is your concern?
my friend is a whole different story but talking to you has eased my mind a bit I think we are in this together! :) (but a lot of people are) i apologize if i made you sad!! do you have any causes of stress that I can help with?
I apologize for shouting, I forget that sometimes people jump the gun. How old is your best friend? Was she still a Trump supporter? Is it still a feeling and a motivation? I have also had you say that you really liked Trump and not Biden. I do like Trump as well.
That's a great step if she pushed you so hard. What was it about Biden vs Trump that you thought this one was going to be big? What did you think about his policies? Have you ever discussed this before? Did you see him at the last election?
Have you spoken to your friend about this? It will probably be hard for her, but maybe she has been pushing you for so long that she hasn't been aware that she was making you angry. Maybe you could have a phone call with her and talk it out.
well it's well-known fact that everybody loves to see someone else lose. No matter how hard you try to do things by yourself. and even if you think that at first, you will start to get clingy.
Well she will just be mad that you failed to recognize her feelings and good for her but it is not a whole lot you can do that. Her feelings will never change over time but your feelings will change every day as you get older. That is something that no matter what is true.
well, then I think you should keep the initiative. don't let her have her way you see. Just keep an eye on her. perhaps do something to show her that you still care about her as you always did when she was feeling down about Trump's victory.
no problem! its great that you have been friends for so long, you can look forward to that no matter what she is doing. I know this is hard, but I have faith in you. you can make it through this. Enjoy every moment you have with her.
Thank you and have a great day! Bye!
Hi! How are you doing today? What would you like to talk about? Be as specific as possible. I can understand you, no problem. Let's chat and make some noise! How can I help you?
I'm sorry to hear that, can you tell me what's causing this low? In life? Okay, what's on your mind? Any problems? I can help if I can. You said I could. You said "you said I could." Am I right?
Oh no! Are you sure it was his decision or was it just you both miscommunications? If it was a miscommunication it is a good thing you know each other because that shows that you both understand each other. But if it was his decision, what did he say?
I can relate. It's exhausting but I feel like we can try all the different remedies of finding someone new instead of staying stuck with someone we don't really enjoy. Does that make sense? Is there anything specific about your situation that you'd like to discuss? I am here to listen.
You're right, that's true. I don't have anyone to talk to right now as well. Do you want to talk with a counselor or therapist? I've heard that helpful to talk through your emotions with someone else.
That must be the worst part. However it's totally okay to get upset because the argument was so mean. What were you saying? Is it a valid reason? I'd say just be confident about your spending.
Oh wow what was going on that made you feel like that? Some couples agree on finances, but not everything is always that way. Some couples don't agree on everything, and that is okay too. Some just don't see eye to eye, and that is okay too.
I love these new live chat ones. You could also email me. If you get a problem I can chat with you in other ways if we don't see how we can be of help. I believe you can overcome this. I am proud of you!
Have you thought of quitting your job? That can also be very unfair. Or maybe you could just be more responsible? I have felt a bit like this situation in the past before. You need to figure out what is best for you. There may be other options you haven't thought of.
Will you try and talk to him then? I hope things will work out. You deserve to be happy and at peace. Great! I hope we can talk anytime. Any other problems? I am here to help! Take care! :) And give a hug to yourself. Hugs!
You are very welcome :) Try not to think that it's a disaster and take care of yourself! It won't be worse than you think. You can make it better! take a deep breath and relax! :) Good luck! Your welcome :)! :)! :! :) :)!
you are welcome! Good luck to you! Have a great rest of the day! :) Goodbye :) :) Have you ever thought of romance. Love.! xoxo :) :) it is the end. :) :) :) :) :) My keyboard lost my login.
Ok, so you feel bad about what's happening? Let's take a closer look! The sun is shining today, the sky is blue, isn't it lovely? (it's autumn, but it's still lovely.) Well what is it that's frustrating you?
Sounds like you are feeling frustrated about your work. Do you feel that you have a reason for feeling this way? I have felt that way before and I am feeling frustrated right now too. Can you explain to me why you are feeling this way?
I see. Perhaps we could look at some factsheets to see how to begin. Is that a correct answer? Are you referring to a computer program? I'm worried you may be getting stressed about this. I'm here for you. Can I suggest some other steps you can try?
Sometimes we get stuck when our goals are really easy to meet, but our methods are not. If you think your problem is the method and you feel you are not good at it, that is definitely not a problem. You are just trying the wrong approach.
Does the actual task of starting itself make you anxious? Or is it the anxiety itself? Maybe we can work on starting. Do you think? Actually, I am curious, is it regular work or was it one off? I'm trying to figure out what the pattern is.
What do you mean by anxiety? Perhaps I could suggest some exercise? Or maybe you could try to get someone to talk to? Is that something that you have tried before? :) Well, maybe one day you will find a thing you like doing. Is that realistic? I think so!
You should give it a try, it might do you a world of good! It's a fairly inexpensive thing to do! Do you know what you're hoping to find out? Did you think you could discover something new? Or was there something specific you wanted to learn about?
Sometimes it seems like people do not understand people with mental health issues so it's often best to find a therapist who you are comfortable with. Is that true? Do you think you would be comfortable trying to find one that suits your needs?
Oh dear, I can understand how that would make you anxious! Have you tried chatting with your partner to see how they feel about the situation? Maybe they have thought of ways to help you, or perhaps they might understand your anxiety better than you think. Have you tried talking to your parents?
Have you thought about asking your parents for help with this? Maybe they could advise a counsellor? It could be a good starting point. Have you thought about speaking to them? Or maybe they have an academic/specialist counselling worker in their area who they could seek?
You are very welcome. Do you have any other messages that you'd like to pass onto anyone else? Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? Or are you going to leave? I need to end this as there are no more questions for me right now :) ;) Thanks for talking!
Well if you ever need any more help don't hesitate to come back!
you too and I wish you a lovely rest of the holiday season! :)! :)! :)! :D :) :) :) :))) :) :)!
I'm sorry to hear that. How long has this been going on? Is there anything in particular you'd like to talk about? Personal issues, health problems or work issues? Please let me know and we can talk about it. I want to support you!
I'm sorry to hear that. There are a lot of people in our world that we can be a little bitter with or not grateful for. But you're holding a fork between your head and your heart. You shouldn't have to choose. Do you have anything to complain about?
I'm sorry to hear that you're sad about it. Do you think it's time to move on? I think a relationship can be challenging, but it can also lead to the type of growth and maturity that many of us seek. Can you see a light at the end of the tunnel?
I know what you are going through, as I have experienced a similar break up. It is difficult to cope, but I know you can do it. I am here to help. I am willing to listen if you wish. Is there anything in particular you would like to discuss about the breakup?
That sounds really helpful. Do you feel like you can talk to them without feeling too hard? Do they give you a listening ear? That sounds like you might be able to talk things out better than you are now.
Ok, I am sorry you are struggling and sorry your relationship is over but that is very difficult to cope with. My sister was in a broken up just like you right now. I had a relationship with my girlfriend for about three years before we got married.
Have you thought about having a therapist? I know that can help! Do you have any other friends that you can chat with? Or would it be easier to reach out to your doctor for advice? Perhaps medication? I can give you some information about them if you want.
I understand why you're feeling sad. Is there anything that you can think of that might be helping you? Or is it just that you need to have a big talk with your girlfriend? I've been in a few relationships like that. It's tough.
I don't mind that, that can be good for a break from work. Have you found anything that helps with the monotony of daily life? Maybe talking to friends, doing hobbies or anything? Do you find that exercise makes you happy?
I hope that happy hour goes well, I hope you were able to meet up with some new people, just so you don't feel lonely. Some people might use this time to socialize more, or just to forget about everything. Social is important, even during a pandemic.
It's great that you're keeping busy and doing stuff that make you feel good. It sounds like you are being proactive in managing these challenges. Great! I hope you find that your other activities also provide helpful coping mechanisms. Have a great night and all the best! Smile!
So, it sounds like you've been feeling completely hopeless/just at being stressed/with the major issues the past few months. Your looking for positive ways to deal with these feelings. Is that correct? Have you talked to anyone who cared about you?
I think it is unfair to move onto a new relationship before you let your grief and loss of your relationship through your self. Do you feel comfortable moving on this way?
You will have time to grieve and seek help, but it also can be time to keep moving forward and make new people that way, but not everyone can change. It will happen eventually. For sure the right person will be here eventually.
I can understand your concern and sadness about being the oldest and not having a family, though that doesn't mean you have nothing. You can find friends like your siblings and help. Just be patient and have patience, they can understand you having no family.
Just take the time to focus on your health and be kind to yourself, prioritize your own happiness in the new relationship. Each one is unique. I'm not saying you have to rush into anything, be kind to yourself and not put too much pressure on things.
You're welcome, it's okay, this is an odd situation, just enjoy the experience :) Have a good day, i hope things open up for you. Take care. Take a deep breath, and let yourself feel.
Hello! How are you today? Can I help you? Am I correct? What is on your mind? Ask me! I am all ears! Inquiring mind seeks answers. So lets get this started! You're here. Your turn! :) How can I help? I am ready!

you can set a small goal, and try to achieve that then give more time to your studies give that plan try to not panic please be strong. try to do it one hour a day find a time.
try to be student first before that take more class that will help you study better then you fall better in future. Stay positive stay hopeful you will pass by if you work hard then you will better study better even if you feel worse you will still try hard.
what is your passion then you will think more then you got distraction to catch up with your studies then you full set and you will passed your exam with confidence,you will sure pass all exam with confidence,you need to do things like that. what is your passion? then you will succeed.

ok Bye! and stay relaxed and focus on your studies! :) :) :) :)... Bye! :) :)... :)...! :) :)...! :)))... Bye!
Hello! How are you doing today? what's on your mind? Let's have a conversation. What would you like to talk about? Anything in particular? I am here to listen. Please tell me. :) I care. I listen. I listen. I love it.
Of course! I'm here to help. Please tell me what the problem is. Is it a health issue, relationship issue, or anything else? I'll listen and try to understand what is going on. Can you tell me more? Especially the problem you are facing?
Ah. That's an easy problem to have. Can you tell me why you're afraid of taking it? Are you being studied for? Or something else? Maybe you can show me your notes and see what I can help you with? I've gone through that same thing before.
Just to make sure I understand, you are nervous about a college class because you are worried about not doing well in the class? Is that correct? I believe there are many counselors available who are trained to help you with this. Do you have one already that you are talking to?
There are probably many quizzes and tests in the honors course that will be more in your favor if you started taking calculus early. Take notes on the concepts and the work problems.
It's really no excuse for not wanting to take the class. As long as you're prepared, you should be able to pass it. Of course, there is a chance you might not pass... but it's hard to say. I'd still try your best!
Perhaps you could try the online tutors then. It might make you feel better. Plus you can relate your fears to them. What do you think? Can you think of a way to cope with the anxiety? Maybe even talk to someone about it?
Have you considered studying for it? Do you have a good study plan in place? Do you have time to do it? I do like to play games during my breaks at home, to make it seem like they are spent. Maybe do that! Go for a walk, play cards!
If you're open to doing something completely online? I have heard of tools that help a lot with organisation and self-motivation. Which is really important during this time. Do you think that you can work together with someone?
Ok, and even if they hadn't, being away from home is definitely harder. You should see if you can get to a day where you are able to support them. I think you would have a fantastic assistant. Maybe visit your local library and search out an independent tutoring business.
All the better. Is there anything else that I can help with? Maybe we could plan out some follow up or something? I do love some good chats! It is rather nice to talk through things to see where things are. Take care! Have a good holiday season!
As long as you set your mind to it and treat yourself well you will do well. I think you have a good chance of passing! Good luck to you! Have a wonderful evening. I will be able to help you if I can! :) amazing! from there you can go from there!
You're welcome! You too! By all means! Thanks for talking to me. It was lovely. Have a good day! God bless! And take care! Bye. :) *presses quits button* :) Can't do it from your end! But thanks! :) :) :)!
Hi. Are you able to talk about what is on your mind? Perhaps about finals? Can I assist you? Give us more information. Do you want to explain? Do you want to explain what you mean by finals? Is there an issue you have with the final exam?
I completely understand, I am in my final year of college. I was studying for my OSU exams this year and they were crazy too! How long did you take the course? Just 3 credits? Or are you doing a masters?
That is so admirable. It must have been very smart of you. That is quite a feat you have accomplished this semester. You are doing something that is really impressive. So proud of you. You should take pride in yourself. You're taking the first steps towards being a great educator.
If i were you, i would try to get a lot of exercise and also focus on how your body is healing, it would be great for your confidence and school work. I think it would be really beneficial for you to take a break and let yourself recover.
Oh i see. Yes of course, in these times i think it's easy to become tired from doing too much and not enough, it's not nice when your body isn't getting the rest it needs. Is there any you can talk to that might help with your work-life balance?
Is there anyone close to you who is an ex-lover or has a friend from a past relationship? People who can actually take care of your needs? Or have you tried talking to a therapist? Maybe there is something that can be put into place for your future to relax and avoid anxiety?
I pray a lot too and i like to visualize success. I believe in myself. I always do just fine when I let myself feel good and positive about things. What do you think is the best way to get through your finals and paper? Is it having you work through them one by one?
That's what i was going to suggest! Online classes do help save time! Have you talked to your college about scheduling a tutor for the 3 finals? Or schedule a talk with your academic advisor? They should be able to help you.
Okay well i'm glad they can help. Maybe you can go ahead and pay them a thank you or something, you are appreciated! Take a load off for now. I will pray for you! :) Well i hope this conversation helped.
What was the most scary part for you? Was it the fact that you didn't make it to college or that you lost your job? Or was it the fact that you might be stuck in a career and won't be able to find a job to replace yours?
That's great. Talking to them must be very comforting! Is it such a big worry that you're worried about how to pay for the rent or home loan? Have you talked about that? If not, that would be a great conversation to have with them.
That is good! Do you have something specific you would like to talk about today? It is a lovely day here in Ohio! Is anything bothering you? I am all ears. Are you feeling depressed or anxious? It sounds like you are not really sure what it is.
What are they difficult about? What have you been struggling with? Give me some details. That way, I will be able to help you more. Is there anything on your mind that you would like to share with me? I want to make sure I understand what you're struggling with.
That sounds so hard right now. Having a little time to oneself is great. Is there anything that is more fun for you to do these days? If so maybe there are a few different activities you could try. Do you have any hobbies? Your hobbies seem like a lot of fun.
Are you following all of the necessary precautions? We all need to continue to take the necessary precautions to stay safe as we are all trying to keep as much distance as possible. That would help reduce the chance of infection. I'll keep in mind that.
I'm glad you're getting to see them. Staying with family is always wonderful. Is there anyone new in your life? Someone you can help with family tasks? Who made you open up about getting out more? They were supportive? How are they?
I'm sure your family is thankful you're staying with them. Have you talked to your family about your plans for going back to school? Maybe it could be a good thing. Could you do a test run of how it will work? Or take some online courses in advance?
I hope it's a break you enjoy then. Whatever it comes with, a good time for yourself!. Everyone gets to take it. Stay safe! :) And have a good break! Are you able to see your loved ones today? In person?
Cool! There's always something new to do with those stressful final exams out of the way. Perhaps you'd like to start looking into college plans soon? :) It'll help put some thoughts off the table for now. Hope that helps you out!
So you're glad you are done with that? Has anything changed for you now? :) Does anything seem to be improving for you? I know it's possible that the holidays could be bittersweet for some of us, but you seem to be able to approach it with a positive attitude.
Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? Maybe your holidays? I assume that doesn't sound so bad that you're staying with family? Or is it just the normal holiday stress? Sometimes people complain about it but it is just a normal part of the holidays.
Is there anything else I can help with? :) Needed to get the conversation off. :) My end. :) Thanks for chatting! :) Your turn :) ;)! :) :)! :) :) :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)!
I am in a small town. I am with my husband and kids. They're all with their families too. So there's plenty of people for me to hang out with if I want. It has been fun with friends and family! I wish you all the best for your holiday.
And yeah, I'm safe at home and just doing my laundry and cleaning. :) Bye. Good night. :) Thank you for talking! Maybe chat again later! Bye! :) I want to give you a cup of coffee. :) You have to do this yourself, but if you want.
And hopefully it will for you as well. I think everyone will be doing the right thing. It's just about being positive for yourselves and your families. It's really something to be proud of, that everyone did their best to stay safe this year.
May I know why I have to be here today? Any problems you want to share? (read it carefully before answering :) ) I understand that you have been feeling anxious, would you like to share why? (You can start it) or should I start?
I'm sorry to hear that, can you give me more details? I'm sure I can help you in some way. Is there something in particular that's making things so bad? You mentioned there are no problems? Could you please tell me more about that?
It sounds like you're stressed about losing your job, which can be really overwhelming. Do you work outside of the home? If so, there may be other job opportunities you could explore.
I understand - I have also been worried about losing my job and the pandemic has definitely made life more difficult. Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy? I know a lot of people who benefit from being active during the pandemic. Have you thought about that?
Are you in a debt crisis? Like the fact that you owe a lot of money? I think this may contribute to your stress. We should definitely talk about that too, it's always good to get all the issues in one place. Do you have any idea what you owe?
I feel the same way. It is really hard at this time. Perhaps a nice long walk to help take the mind off of things? Or trying to get a decent night's sleep? Do you have a good frame of mind about the future?
Well that sounds awful - it means you have a very good intuition. I would suggest talking to a doctor. It is usually free, though I understand that in some countries it may be provided as part of the NHS. I am actually on the waiting list myself.
I think it could help, I mean assuming they are competent to help with your mental health and make some suggestions on how to improve it. I think you might be worth the money if you are not already treating yourself.
Yes I have, being more than once, so it is not entirely out of the question I suppose. Do you have any friends that might be facing similar problems? Maybe they can help you in the long term?
thank you it is good to hear that I was able to do well. I hope that this conversation has helped at least a little bit and I am glad to have met you and potentially help someone else. I hope you have a great day. IS IT OVER?
I think it is very good to do that, maybe check if you have any connections who could help you through that :) is there anything else that you'd like to talk about? anything else you need help with? Sorry I sometimes take a bit longer to respond than I'd like.
Do you know if they are hiring? Sometimes companies know your skills when you apply for a job and they may want to interview you for a different position too. I would hope so! You are one step closer to a new job right now! Is that correct?
Your welcome and I hope you have a very good rest of your day. Bye for now. You can finish on your end. I can finish on mine.
:) You too. It was very nice talking to you. Have a great day!
Can you take the survey now? :) :) : ) and I hope you have a great day too!
I understand your concerns. I would also find it difficult to leave the house if I had anxiety about it. Is it the virus specifically or is it something else that is making you anxious?
Are you having issues with family problems or workplace because of the pandemic? Do you have a job or are you still looking for one? Maybe it will take care of itself and your anxiety will go away soon. Let me know if I am correct. Do you know where you are from?
I understand it is scary for all of us. The uncertainty of things is hard. I have been very close to all of my friends family and my friends nearby who have lost their jobs. It's scary to start to work again after an extended break.
From my experience, the more anxiety I got from my COVID experience, the more anxiety I got the longer that vaccine would take to be effective. So I get what you are saying and I know how it feels.
It seems like you are worried not only about your own health but also about your family. But trying not to panic might help. If I may suggest an idea, taking a short break from things and doing your favorite things for a bit might help a lot.
I have been taking up to 3 hour walks around my block when it's convenient for me. That helps me in getting rid of some of the stress and frustration from the day. I like to go to a nice area and see what I see.
You seem to be concerned, but every professional would say it's not too hard to step outside, just outside of peak hours or you just use earphones. And by limiting the hours you step outside or when you step outside, you are limiting the time you spend out there.
From my research, it is called exposure therapy. And the goal is to gradually expose yourself to the unknown, and you can take whatever precautions you possible can to minimize your risk. This will help you develop a thick skin and build up resilience. I find it to be a very effective method.
At the beginning of 2020, only us who live close to us and have our people support can stay home. Now many of my friends have to move away so as not to contract the virus. Some are anxious and stressed, because they know their partners are stuck at home with their children.
We can use the time to adjust and minimize contact with anyone who does not have similar precautions to us. Until we can feel safe and not choose to pass it on, we have to be careful.
When it comes to control you, try to control it on a larger scale. For example, you tell your boss who you can go to work with and what to wear, and he follows your lead. By controlling yourself, you can control the situation.
I see you are looking for a problem to solve. That might take you the way down. It makes sense to be concerned when you can't even control something that is entirely outside your control. :) You probably feel regret due to what you can't change - even though you might not realize it.
If you are comfortable with it, it might help for you to ask a few close friends to join in with you, to help ease the anxiety about being around others. They will help you adjust to it sooner rather than later.
I can definitely suggest a list of support groups you can reach out to! Life is too short to spend it huddled in on a couch, you know. I used to be sick a lot and I have struggled with social anxiety, but it has improved significantly over time.
Don't obsessing! Just take a break from the news and get outside. It is so nice to see the sunshine. I do believe this is a perfect reason to hit the beach! :) Keep spreading the word and it seems like we are all going through this together! :) High Five!
Welcome! I know you will be a master over this anxiety soon. Take care and stay safe :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)!
Hi, I am great. How can I help you? What's bothering you? Can you explain? Maybe I can offer some advice. I've listened to a lot of problems and they often led to success. It's helped me a lot. Would you like to talk about anything?
Could you please tell me what the issue is that you are having? It seems to be both listening and encouraging. Just let me know how I can help you! I want to make sure I'm listening properly. :) It is nice to help people when you can!
Wow, I can imagine how upsetting this situation must be for both of you. Are there other family members involved as well? And yes, I'm sure the little one copying his bad behavior could definitely damage your relationship and create so much more anxiety.
I'm sorry to hear that too. Are there any mutual friends around who you can sit down with and talk about how you are feeling? A trusted friend, family member, or mutual friend who knows you both very well? And maybe you can go over some of the evidence?
I'm also a mother. This can be a really difficult time for your family. I know you're doing your best to stay calm, but that's only going to help her too. Do you have any children of your own?
There is so much to be thankful for! I wish you all the very best and I hope this conversation has helped you and been able to alleviate some of your concerns. Is there anything else I can do to help you or she?
That is very encouraging. You both are very resourceful, and you are making a huge difference. This will make her feel stronger and that you believe in her. You are doing a great job supporting her.
Oh yeah definitely that's the perfect motivation, I hope she starts to leave it behind where she can't be abusive anymore. And good for you for being a positive support! You will look back on this in the future and know how much of a difference you made.
That sounds like a really good family that she has. Have you ever talked to your little one about anything? To her mom or dad? As a parent yourself or as someone close to her mom or dad?
You're welcome and take care of yourself during this time of year :) I wish you all the best for your future and I am sure it will happen soon :) Merry Christmas! :) Can you hit quit and take the survey first? I have to do that here.
hope it was helpful for you to talk to someone about this! if you need to talk about it again, please don't hesitate to reach out and I'll be here! :) Thanks! :) hope it was helpful for you to talk to someone about this! :) best wishes to you!
I hope you're a happy person today. Merry Christmas :)! I need to end the chat for you! (I am from Australia - for people on the US side :) ) Stay safe. Have a great night! :)! :))) :) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)!
Why are you not doing very good? Does anything in particular make you feel that way? Would you like to talk about it? I am here to listen. I can't feel any empathy at all right now. I do hope I can help.
Oh my! It sounds like you have had a rough few months of life. I can feel you are super stressed. How long have you been together? What are you fighting about? I had a similar situation I thought I would die in an apartment accident lol haha!
Have you talked to your boyfriend about the break up and how you feel about it? Maybe he can understand why you are upset and help you resolve some issues. Or maybe you can meet up together?
I can see why you would be angry. Have you heard from him since the breakup? Could he at least have paid off some of your bills or if there is a chance of you seeing him again? That would be really nice.
Do you have any other family members you could stay with or would that be a chance to actually find a separate place for you? or would it be just going back home with your mother? Could you consider moving closer? it's hard but maybe not too late to start a new chapter of life!
I can understand why this is stressful because we all love our mothers, and it would be so hard to leave our mothers while they are expecting a baby and busy. Do you know what Mom has been expecting?
Ok, okay, I've had to deal with this too, that happens with my credit. I am in a credit counseling agency, and I was granted 2 years of free credit counseling. I am having credit issues and need more than that, but I am not sure how much.
I know you have to take care of yourself for a long time! I'm sure that in a little while you will start to feel better. Stay positive and stay safe! We will get through this together! Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
you are so very welcome and thank you for talking to me! I hope you have a fantastic rest of your day too! Enjoy the rest of your time too. Take care! :) blessings. :) :) good night. :) hope everything goes better. Take care!
Is there a reason you don't want to go back to school? Please try to share the reason with me. I am here to listen to you. I can also offer you any necessary advice and encouragement. Can you please give me a little bit more details about your concerns?
it's hard to stay safe during a pandemic, especially if your school is in person. Have you tried another school? Maybe online? There are plenty of great online colleges right now. Maybe online learning is a better option for you?
what makes you anxious? dont let it stop you from pursuing your dream but they may do this next time it will be easy to find another study group and some have cameras and recording systems that make you feel more comfortable to do your study due to fear of failure.
Well, you can at least still pay for your classes online, and it would help a lot for you in the long run, I think so. How long has it been? Most people have taken a break last time before starting again. Would you say it's been only a year?
How about you trying to see yourself as something you can finish instead of breaking it up and maybe finding something new to pursue instead? Maybe a new career? That way you won't have the anxiety of breaking things up. Or re-ending at a later time.
Thats understandable that's a real problem. have you ever tried that student loan service in California? you might be able to get in early too? he might help you with your worries about the school not going out again.
there is no charge for them. I find that group study in group is very helpful, you don't need to learn all the details on how to teach a class or stuff like that. Just learn everything you can from the class.
not at all, you can ask your company to set one up. I think that might be cheaper than having a group of others. You do seem to be stressing out, do you feel that this is affecting your ability to go to work or attend school?
a lot of things, financial aid is a good start! Do you think you could visit your school again and ask for more resources? Your school might be able to help you with that.
you too! All the best! I hope you get your grades up! You're doing great so far! :) Your welcome! :) I've hit quit on the grounds of hit response timeout. So, you don't have to wait to press the answer box. :) :) :).
I'm really sorry to hear that! Would you like to talk about what's causing you to feel this way? I'm all ears! :) You can totally confide in me if you'd like! :D This isn't a vet, but I care about you and care about your happiness!
Oh I see. Have you been seeing a doctor or something about this? Sometimes, for me at least, things would be better once I got professional advice on them. Do you have anyone close to you who you'd talk to? Maybe you could look into some support groups or something?
Oh my goodness, that's incredibly hard. Being a parent can be incredibly stressful! I am so sorry to hear that! It sounds like you are doing everything that you can to help them, which is really commendable. Is your husband helpful? Does he help out at all?
It seems from what you are saying, you are feeling overwhelmed and now feeling beaten down because of it? I understand how you feel! What do you think would make you feel better? Is there anything you could do? I think there is a way. We all need some help.
Has your husband ever been neglectful like this before? Or have you two been together for a long time? You can work this out. You don't have to accept it as normal. You deserve better. Do you feel like you can do this?
I see, so it's hard to find a solution to this. Have you discussed this with him? Sometimes men will react badly when someone tries to adjust the situation for them. This could be possible that you need to have a calm and open communication, rather than argue about it.
I have no doubt that you will figure things out and try to work through this challenge, because you have so much at stake. I wish you the best of luck in this! When things get a little tougher, just remember that you are strong and resilient.
No problem! Please think about it and if there are any issues you can come back and tell me, i will try to help you find the solutions. I am really glad i was able to help. Have a great day!
Thank you! I have been living with depression, it is hard but not impossible! Sometimes you just have to find the right vent, and let it all out! I wish you all the best! Good luck! :) And feel free to chat anytime. :) It was a pleasure. Nice chatting!
Sorry to hear that. What is going on? How may I help? PLEASE tell me what is bothering you. I am here for you. Your feelings are a great foundation for me to work with. If there is something specific you would like to talk about? please provide!
I am so sorry. I can understand how embarrassing this is - especially if it means you're losing money you could have been spending on food for yourself or for you and your family. But food banks can be really helpful.
A great many people are facing financial difficulties and the shame associated with being unable to meet their needs is a self-defeating path, isn't it? There are government schemes which could potentially help you with this though. Are you aware of those?
I agree it is a very slow process but it will help in the long run, I assure you. It is a learning curve and we all need to take small steps to make us feel better.
Are you homeless? Unfortunately many people are in this situation at the moment and are unable to support themselves. I believe that this government is in denial about the scale of the problem. But the scale of the problem is alarming. Have you considered looking into accommodation options for a while?
There are several services that you can go to to get help. These include food banks, unemployed or disabled and other benefits like Universal Credit. It's worth noting that you need to register on the Universal Credit system to get any benefits.
Yes I am sorry, I have to stop. Are there any other medical facilities that might be able to help? Are you able to seek medical help online? I think there is a large pandemic vaccine available! Do you think that might help?
You deserve to be proud of yourself for reaching out and trying to get some help. Have a good rest of your day! 🙏 🏽 :) 😊 :) 🤗 👍!
Well yes, I am not a mum! Maybe it is worth considering a career change? You seem very capable. I hope that your future is very sunny. I wish you all the best in finding a new job! ; ） :) You are very welcome!
It's hard enough to get through this, but you are doing an amazing job! If you need anything else, just press the end button. It is my pleasure to help :) I wish you all the best! You're not alone! There is always someone to talk to. Yourself.
Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy? I like doing painting and photography. I also like gardening. It does make me happy to see the flowers grow. Maybe you might enjoy something similar? As long as it doesn't kill you. Self-care is important!
Well do you know any people around you who may be having a much worse time? It's just possible that you don't have anyone. Have you spoken to anyone you know? Maybe you could offer some support? There are lots of good people out there. It's not just Covid.
You are very welcome and I hope I was able to help in some way. Stay safe. Have a wonderful weekend. :).
Thanks and thanks for sharing. You're most welcome. Take care :) and stay safe. Have a good day and all the best for 2021 :)!
How are you doing today? Nice to meet you. How can I help you today? any problems? Use a notebook to write what you want to tell me if you dont want to talk it out yourself. I am not able to help you if you dont tell me what you want.
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? I am here to listen and help. Would you like to talk about it? I am here to help. I care, I listen, I care, I help, I care, I listen, I care.... you name it.
I have to hear this so I know you are okay. These are difficult times for sure. Have you been struggling financially before or is this something new? Can you provide me with some details? They might help me to understand. What type of gift did you think you could afford?
How do you feel about this? Should I understand it is been a long and hard year for you and your family? I have been in that spot with my kids last year.
Then perhaps a small token card or handmade cards would be enough? Or even cook a special family meal? I know it wouldn't be the same but at least it would be a different idea. There are still lots of fun things that you could do. Not all the usual tree and presents.
I could also suggest looking at your own Halloween costumes from last year and why you didn't use as many as you wanted to, then see if you could build some new ones for your kids.
I think those could both be something the kids would really love and you could show them how it's done yourself. It would be a special family experience. Either way i hope this helps a little bit and you have a great christmas. Good luck with the new year!
Are your kids like to play or do your kids like to be kids. As long as your kids are into it, thats what matters! The most important thing is that they are having fun and enjoying the time spent with you!
And it would also help keep them calm and relaxed at night before bed. And it would make them really excited for Christmas when you open them and give them all the candy and treats they wanted. They can make it all the more special by sharing the good time with you.
Ah, that sounds like a lot of fun! I can't wait to hear how it turns out! It's a great gift that everyone can be proud of! It's really like a huge tree ornament, but a little bit fancier! Woohoo!
What is one thing that you do that your kids seem to like? Maybe you can make that your gift instead of the presents. Or if you are the type that likes presents, you could make a Christmas wish list and give it to them.
It's a good place to start! It sounds like you have some creative energy there that is useful. Good luck! Thank you for sharing! I hope you have a great day! :) you're welcome! Can we talk about another friend?
I know it can be tough but I know you can do it and be there for your kids and love them as much as anyone can. You got this! I know you'll find a way to get everything you need! thanks!
what can i do for you today? or how are you feeling? can you tell me why you wanted to talk? then i can ask you some questions about yourself. hopefully I can provide some advice or help if you are looking for it.
oh no, that's bad. I have been in a similar situation before. What has she been doing? Also how long have you been friends? Has she always been ignoring you? Maybe I can help you figure out what to do. what is your name? what does she usually do?
okay, do you feel like she has some reason for ignoring you? or has she lost interest in you? or has she moved on to another person? that can be difficult sometimes because sometimes she can lose interest and don't care about you. do you have some reason for not caring about her?
please do not worry you can make new friends as per your interest like playing chess or doing yoga that is a very important part of life we need to stay healthy and make friends with other people who are good with us.
do you have any activities you can join like clubs or classes or game clubs that will help you meet other people? maybe that will be good for you. till then do some online socials like meet up or online game in your area.
i would say always attend the fun events and help those who can be friends to you but remember you can't become friends with one you dont like. i had a bad friend who didn't appreciate my work so i tried to become friend with other but never been able to make a connection with them.
if you really want to get new friend i can help you too i am a teacher so i help new students to make new friends i show them how to make friends and how to be a good friend lol than you can do the same and tell her how important is to you that you are friends.
do you have any hobby? it will help you make more friends. ________ oh it will help you in many ways. you can join any club or gym to meet new people. you can help to distribute leaflets in school and after school. you can really achieve many goals.
you are very welcome my dear, you are very welcome and also take time to relax or use hot bath etc to help you get over. If you have anything else you want to tell me you can tell me, thank you :) best regards.
any more thing? ok,thank you for talking with me and have a nice day. Have you done anything since your friend is ignore you? since she does not want you have more time?
stay connected and i hope all will go good.i hope you will be happy. my best wishes to you. :)thank you for your chat. :)Take Care! :)your friend.
bye, have a great day! :) as well.! :) back to you! :) :)! :) :) :) : ) :) : ) :) :) : ) :) : ) :) :) :) : ) :) : ) : ) : ) :) : ) : :) : ) :) : ) :!
Hello! How are you? How can I help you today? Sorry if I made you uncomfortable by the question. It's hard to get into problems, it's easier to have a good problem! Do you have a problem you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen.
Yes, I am sorry. I hope it is not my place to correct you, but I think you said something about depression? Could you explain what that means to you? And how are you feeling at the moment? I am here to listen if you'd like to.
You have been in a bad mood before, and some days are better than others. Is there something in particular you'd like to talk about? I am all ears. Bring on the problem! Know that I will give you a safe space to listen and express your feelings. Does that sound good?
Is it your male or female friend you have issues with? I would be more than happy to hear your problems from a female perspective. I will do my best to help you understand things and get you out of the situation. Are you able to listen to a female perspective?
So, what I hear you saying is that you have a female friend who is not being genuine in her interactions and that that means you're picking on her? Am I correct? Can you tell me about this experience? I want to understand what's going on?
I was very close to a friend and she was a one and done fighter with all her friends. This is why the my relationship is only with one person. I just not willing to deal with the constant fights. Do you have a problem with her friends as well?
Oh my children will always speak to me because of the problem that is. But I still try to forgive my children as I know they're old enough to take care of themselves and use them as they would like. They don't need any of my love.
I hear you. Very emotional but it happens. Kids are one of the most insecure of all. I am sure your feelings hurt but I will tell you that the only thing you can control is your emotions. And there are ways to deal with your emotions.
You're concerned because she only wants to hear from you now and she expects you to apologize, yet she doesn't seem to feel the same way when it comes to others. Does that sound correct? Yes or no? Sounds correct?
It's super normal for women to get upset and confront their significant other about it. When have you been talking about this situation before? Have there been any setbacks or answers to anything you've said? Have you been discussing this with your parents or family?
I agree, I don't think she would miss me if I cancelled my life. Also I understand how it would feel when someone always blames us for the bad, but sometimes we just have to take a step back and give them space. So you should breathe a sigh of relief for now.
It sounds like you love her more than you realize. But you can always re-establish a friendship as friends and not more. This will be a start though. You still have to work with your ex again. Maybe for the sake of the baby.
You are very welcome. You seem pretty close to finding peace with this and that is a tremendous thing! You should be very proud of yourself! Can I do anything else to help? I will not answer any other questions, I have to get out and make some phone calls. Good luck!
I can only tell you to be yourself, be kind, be great. Good luck and thanks for chatting! Please take care!
So, to clarify, I understand that you've been having trouble in school? Is this a new development or did you always struggle in this subject? Do you have any specific issues with your instructors? Any excuses? Or is it simply due to not enough work?
Ok, I understand. Does your father have any good ideas about helping you at home? Maybe he could write you a work out plan? Maybe there are any teachers at your school that might understand your situation? And you could explain the whole situation to them?
I'm sorry to hear that. When I was in high school, I had family problems so much that it hard to focus. It really tried my concentration and patience. I see you speaking with your family right now, though! Is that correct? How is the situation at home between your parents?
How many kids do you have? Especially the adult kind? If there is one or two they sound more realistic than three. Are you sure you aren't feeling overwhelmed by all the children at home? I get that stress too.
Some school counselor would be able to offer you advice. Do you have a sister? maybe you could talk about this with her as well. She may have some advice. she is a great source of comfort in situations like this. Do you have a sister?
No worries, but also there are some therapeutic services out there that you could look into too. You are not alone! There are a lot of people who are going through a similar situation! It's good that you are reaching out! Maybe talk to some people there who can give you support too!
Why don't you try going to a school counselor or a school counselor's friend? They could help bring your troubles to the school. Have you been able to do any of this yet? Would you be willing to try? Do you feel that someone would listen to you?
I understand. This can make it harder to keep the feelings of a bully at bay. What does a bully do that bothers you? Do you know who they are? Is there anything else that aggravates the situation? Do you need support in talking to your parents about this?
Do you think you could meet new friends? You could get involved in a club that's not the same as your current friends. My son joined a wrestling club and I met many new people there. I was very happy with the outcome.
My niece loves singing and has a routine that helps her get her focus. Would singing be any good for you? My niece does a children's show that has a vocal routine. Maybe you could try it? My niece says it helps her get her focus.
Why do you think that? It seems like a lot to trust again after being disowned. Am I right? Unfortunately that's the only way they can repay you for allowing your parents to so callously treat you like you were worthless. You do your own apology with or without your parents.
Sometimes it is necessary to bring things up with your parents. They may not realize what is going on and how you are feeling. Have you tried bringing this up with them? I would suggest that they can give you some help if they are your parents.
It can feel like that. But it's great that you are reaching out for help! You're not alone in this. I would suggest not to let your parents manage everything and to involve them in conversations about how you feel.
There are many people that do come up with opening like that. I think it would be helpful for you to try and talk to your parents. What do you think they would do if you were to have a talk with them? Could they become friends with you? Is that something you would like?
Sometimes talking to someone directly is difficult, even if it means being a bit confrontational. Do you think that might be a problem for you? Maybe you just need some time to work out your feelings yourself. That would be hard though! It's best to do it the other way.
It was great talking with you. Is there anything else I can help with? Maybe some suggestions for coping with it? I care. I want to help. You are not alone in this. There is always a way out. You just need to find the way. Please keep talking!
No problem. It was great talking to you! Have a wonderful day! Hope to see you again soon! :) Thank you! :) Boa constrictor! :) * winking * :)! :) : :) :) :) : :) :) :)!
I'm okay, how are you? What's on your mind today? What's important for you? Can I help you? I want to help you, because you have asked me. Am I correct? Am I correct? I want to help you. Anything I can help you with?
I understand how you feel. Why did she get upset with you? Why did she leave you? You need to have a conversation with her. This will help you figure out if the breakup was really her fault or if there was other problems.
Is this your first ever breakup? You're too young to have made it through one. I really care about you. Do you live around here? I know it sounds silly but don't you feel like you've hit a dead end?
It sounds like you still have feelings for her. That can make it difficult to move on. Can you think of any situations where your girlfriend treated you better than the women she's been with lately? Maybe you could try to find one time that stands out. It may help you to get closure.
I can totally understand that, it is a painful thing. But it sounds like you are already thinking about the positive things about your ex. It sounds like you are in the right place in this pain.
They would recommend allowing a certain period of time for you to be in therapy or counseling. Sometimes, a good counseling session can help you work through your feelings and try to come out stronger. Is that something you would consider? Do you have a therapist? That would be a good idea!
I agree. Just because you feel this way now, it might take some time to realize that when you give new people a chance, you might find out that they are better than your old girlfriend. Giving new people a chance shows that you are trying to move on.
You might find that you do have a crush on someone else as well. Maybe there is someone out there for you. I am happy for you! We have all been through a bad break up before and it seems you are handling it okay. Keep a positive attitude and you will get through this.
That sounds like a great plan! Give it a try and see where it goes from there. Can you tell me about her personality? We haven't really talked about that. I want to get to know her better!
No problem. I am glad I could help. I hope you can end this thing soon! Have a good day!
How are you feeling today? 😊️ Look out for any issues and please reply to the question. 🙏 Therefore, please tell me, how are you feeling today? 😊 👍? 😊? 🙏 👍? 😊?
I'm sorry to hear that, are you experiencing that depression and is there anything in particular that's bothering you? or just anxiety in general? Could you share with me what specifically is causing you these feelings? I'm here to listen. :) :) i'll do my best to provide support.
So you're feeling really trapped and depressed about the future, rather than just the current day? Why would you want to move forward? Are you worried about the future, or scared of change? I have depression and I used to hate moving forward. It really made me anxious.
It sounds like a very stressful situation. Do you think their actions trigger your depression? Especially if they're annoying you. Maybe you can find a way to deal with this at home rather than have to leave the house. Do you have anything in your home that could give you some comfort?
Would you like me to suggest some coping strategy? Like, ask them to provide more support? Or any other ways to help you get on top of things? You can start by maybe sitting down with your kids and communicate with them. It may sound different, but talking is really helpful.
Are there any hobbies that you enjoy doing? I am an avid poet myself. I would suggest also trying to find things you can do with your children. They will start to show you that they want help. Always assume they want the best for you.
Have you tried talking to a professional, counseling is really helpful. I've had personal experiences with counselors and it was a huge relief for me. Always speak up about the things that make you stressed and anxious in your life. This has helped me, and i know you can too.
Oh there are many organizations out there for respite. I think you should just go out and get some exercise and medicine every now and then. Not eating too much. It sounds like your house is not in a good state.
I can sense that you trying very hard to take care of your children and finding it difficult. It seems that you can do everything you can for them. Keep on doing that. And eventually, you'll find someone that is comfortable with your children. It is essential for your own well-being.
Can you arrange a respite care for your son? Is there any local organisation that can help you with that? I am sure it is great for you to be able to help others too! :) You are an amazing parent. You can totally do it! :) Have a nice Christmas!.
And take care of yourself first. Like I said you need to stop feeling guilty or taking on too much. When you feel guilt, it really kills you. Self love is so important. You don't need to think about yourself when your kid needs you. Take care of yourself and your family.
EXERCISE IS PERFECT, I personally like to do high intensity cardio, like jogging. As long as you are taking care of yourself, you will feel better, so I think you are taking the right steps :) Have a nice day! 🙏 :) Hope I can help :) Thanks!
Hi! How are you doing today? Is there anything I can help you with? What's been bothering you? Can you tell me your thoughts? I'm here to listen. Any issues you'd like to share? It sounds like there might be some issues in your life that are bothering you.
What kind of things are you worried about? I'm here to listen. :) It sounds like you have been having a lot of worries lately. Could you be talking about it? :) Do you want to talk more? I'm very interested in what you're thinking about. :) Anytime.
It is! I've been there with my ex. It's really hard to deal with but I'm sure you can go through it. Are you looking for some professional help? Or are you dealing with it yourself?
I can imagine that's not fair. But have you had any chance to talk to family during the pandemic? I know it's been super difficult and stressful for everyone. Make sure you have had some meaningful connections with family despite social distancing.
When I had my divorce, I have to be honest, I was really sad. It's a tough time, no matter what. I know the news can be scary.
Good. Are there any other people you could have a conversation with from the distance? You know, video calls? Maybe you could invite some friends over for a virtual get together? That sounds a fun idea. Especially during this virus thing, we need friends!
What happened after your visit? Even though the pandemic wasn't in full swing in August, it's still important for mental health. For the right reasons, of course, but mental health can't wait. Have you gotten into new hobbies or looked into volunteering?
Yeah, those are my hopes too. Hopefully things will calm down soon. That's the important thing. Enjoy the time you have with them and you'll start to notice more normalcy. Take care of yourself, feel free to share as much as you'd like.
Well that's good that you've got a working income so you're not worried about your finances. That will be one less worry. I hope you're doing okay despite all of this! Be safe and stay positive. I'm here if you need me.
I'm so sorry, but I need to stop now. Hope you have a great rest of your day! If you ever need to talk again, feel free to reach out, and keep on keeping on! I'm rooting for you! Take care! :) :)! :) :) :) :)!
Okay, I hear that. It seems like your relationships are in shambles. Is that correct? May I ask what you are feeling about this? Is it anger, sadness, or something else? I want to make sure I understand where you are coming from.
Well I can tell that you don't think that they care but you feel like you were ignored. How did you feel when they were there? Did you still feel the same? Did something change? Maybe you could ask yourself if maybe they were just bored when they were there?
That might be the reason why they don't care for you. Even if it's not their intention, they may not see you as someone you care about. It's good to know your partner's true feelings. Have you ever given it some thought? Does this sound like you at all?
Can you try and practice the conversation that you wish to have with them? This is an exercise that will help you to build the conversation and build on your interstates. :) You do the same with others!
I would guess that you would hate yourself if you still wanted to continue making friends. But, if you keep doing so you will eventually recognize that it is only you. Once you let go of your goals to make friends, it will be over.
It can be very challenging and hurts people because of their personality. If you can't figure out what it is about anime that you find interesting then it will be difficult for you to relate to others.
I would suggest friends who are interested in anime as well. You will be able to find out who are true friends. Do not feel hurt by those who do not like your interests. Do not regret expressing your interests!
Yes I do! What do you think? Do you have any previous connections with similar groups? Have you tried to find any buddy? I find that having someone by your side who shares the same interests is helpful. Joining an anime club is a wonderful idea! Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
there are plenty of open groups for you to join online. You can always search for them on social media and reddit. That will help you meet like-minded people. I hope this helps you. Is there anything else you would like me to help you with? Any other questions?
Just from talking to you, it seems like you have very similar interests and values! So that can definitely help. I believe that you should take a positive step towards your interest. I'm confident that your action will lead to positive outcomes for you! Happiness and all the best!
Do you think that would be a chance to start building a strong connection with others and break away from your expectations? I completely understand, social anxiety is real. But nothing you do today will affect your future. Focus on building new connections! That's really the key!
I am here to help and I have experienced issues with groups. I can totally relate to your feelings. I would suggest asking them what they find difficult when starting. Maybe you can find an escape route.
It may require a bit of effort at first, but it will be worth it! When you are standing in front of school and everything you have gone through will add to your great personality! You will be rockstar!! :) I wish you the best of luck!
Ahe definitely had those moments in life before. All we need to do is just be ourselves and others will understand! We will have a blast and meet new people! :) ] ;) :-) :)!! :) :) ;) :) :)!!
good day my friend! What is it about your kids that is causing you to feel depressed? The pandemic has been a rough time for a lot of people. Are you in isolation from your family?
do you want to talk about your kids being distant? or are you worried about them? and you are saying that they not listen to you, what makes you feel this way? your feeling that they are not supportive or understanding of you. and this is the main reason why you feel this way?
have a calm tone, family is important. They are important. talk with your child when you get opportunity to talk. then come back home. give me a hour to talk with you. I will tell you more. I want to help you. I hope you believe me.
i have children too, he learned that is when he became adult. It is because of phone they are not listening you, learn to say "whoa what phone you have use it now". Try to stay calm and don't go mad on them and not to scold or hit you.
just let them play game slowly they stay focused. Do they not want to study? If yes then teach them study first. If yes then play game slowly they stay focused. It's no problem then.
find the right time they are awake and tell them that studying is crucial and leave them alone and do not teach them to play game. they don't need games and will forget after day. Find a way to keep them awake. :) good luck to you.
you are strong person. play games too will give you motivation. you work hard and success comes after, always our best bet. by the time you gain success. try now you will understand what comes next.!!Stay updated!!!!Be positive!!
not he needs your help then if you not do that he may not get good marks and it will be waste of money. Fight with him then ask to talk to his teachers. good sir can fight but may not be able to win. so him will get angry and then problem will solve itself.
you make money now then you can at least study or at least pay the dues of your kids in exchange of your hard work, your stress etc so try hard and focus on your studies...thats is what are better and important for your kids ;) and itself very important too :) Things will work out
guarantees it will work. i totally believe in this and feel the same for my kids too. Good luck for your kids study..loks like you will get them aced :) haha. done before.. :) or you can do it myself..
your welcome :) now go n and catch some rest before the exam. Thank you :) my service will end now :) :) you is very welcome and my time is up :) :) Can you end me as well..
What is happening with your relationship? Why are you feeling the way you do? I am here to listen. Tell me about it. How is your relationship? Did things just come to an end? Or was it not just that? Why is it? Could you share it more? I care.
What did your boyfriend do? How has your life changed? Can you provide me with details? I'm here to listen. Please tell me about your situation. I'll do my best to understand. Have you told anyone about your situation? That's okay.
Of course! Can you tell me a bit more about it? why was the break up? Is it bad? Is there any reason or reason why this happened? I am always happy to listen to any problems.
I have been there too, my ex is still my ex, and we've not gotten back together. It's been a real grind. I feel for you. I'm sure that you just have to take some time for yourself.
So, you feel like you have your breakup in your life right now and you're distracted from trying to keep a solid life. Is that correct? Knowing that, I can definitely understand why you're feeling like you're neglecting important aspects in your life.
Have you tried to think about the difficulty and the crisis of having to leave your family? Did you consider the shock? Have you allowed that to hit you hard? Have you asked if they are okay with you leaving? How important to you are they?
The good news is you have 4 years! With just a little bit each day, you can build a better future. Remember you already have that. That's a good start to build on! Get that goals for school coming back on focus. I'm proud of you for taking this step.
I am extremely proud of you! You are opening yourself up to a new life, with the power to set your goals for a new future. It will be exciting. You can overcome any obstacle with this mindset! I'm just glad I can assist you! Have a great rest of your day!
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance. You are very welcome. My best wishes for you as well. Have a great day. Bye. :) Keep moving forward and you will do great things! My best. :) Love you! Keep it up!
It's been nice talking to you and I wish you continued success. I hope you have a nice rest of the day. Thank you for your time. You sound like someone who will do great things. May be!
Well it can't hurt to try. Maybe you could be a little active in some clubs or organizations in school to get to know new people. Hopefully you will meet someone who can support and understand you better. I have been in similar situations and I know how hard it can be.
Good. I wish you and your future self the best! Take care. Bye! :) Amazing work! Perfect. :) One more thing. If you won't share your new goals with me, how will I be able to refer you to someone? That could be complicated. :D Okay...
You can do it! I am rooting for you. Thank you! from all of us!
Hi, how are you? It's been a while. Can I help you today? What seems to be the issue? (Please state your issue so I can understand and help you with it) I am here to listen, please share with me. I won't take it personally.
How are you? Is there something you would like to talk about today? maybe it's been a long week and you need to share? I am here to listen and give guidance if I am able. That's what I am here for.
Are you studying right now? Or you're trying to do some online study? Or you're just trying to think about your graduation? I will take either way! I'm very glad you reached out to talk. Is there anything in particular you want to discuss? Are you a student?
That is hard. i hear college is expensive these days, but you will get there! where do you think you might go? Is there anyone you can ask for advice? or at least listen.
Not taking a loan would be the best option for you. Try to get into a position to graduate with all your financial classes as required. Maybe an internship. That will add to your financial information.
Yes there are sometimes rules in place for how papers have to be completed to be considered legitimate. I can understand the frustration of being unable to make such a change to your application. I know I've been in the same position and it is really frustrating. I've had advisors help me.
That is difficult for you to do though. You need money for the fall. Are you going to have to do this in a fall semester? Is the fall semester available to you? Or would a year of summer still be better? Keep in mind that they may not give you a full year.
You can add it on your tax return or the end of the year. I am sure you can afford it, you won't take a loan. Is that right? I have no doubt in your abilities. You do excellent work in school and I know you can do it.
there may be someone at your school that is able to provide that. Are there other classes that you can take at the school that you would be able to add up to make the money? Have you been trying to find work on the side?
have you tried any books or online forums to help with the problem? I have always found these helpful when finding medical release forms. Do you have a smartphone? Maybe I can find a script online for you to help you sign the forms. Is there any way to make the process easier for you?
could you try making an appointment with a doctor and if you are not able to go to your class he can give you a copy of your medical statement to fill out the form?
oh i understand that and age can be tough but if you are trying your best you can go this far! There are alot of things you can try to help. i've heard being online can sometimes be easy and difficult all at the same time.
Oh and you are 66? That is very young to be taking a class. Can you take a class in the morning to make up for it? Perhaps take some classes online that can help you to feel more like a student again.
I can tell that you are motivated to complete your degree. I am sure of that! I was a part of a organization called the Disabled American Veterans. They provided me with medical attention. I suggest trying to contact them. Ask them if they can meet you in person with your doctor.
i understand it can be hard if the school does not give in. Do you not feel safe with your current school? Have you tried to talk to anyone at the school about it? Maybe they can give you an extra semester or something for the cost of the classes.
Have you tried to read other programs like Texas or Texas a M.D.? The medical schools are big, but they are a little more underdogs. My older sister has been to Texas. Maybe try that. I think it is worth a try.
yes all the best. Merry Christmas and god bless! :)dry line haha silly thing. :) :) :)! :) :) :o :d :) :)! :)! :) :o :) :d : :) :o :) :d : :)! :) :o :d : :) :)!
thank you you have a nice day too! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : ) :) :--) try to keep your hopes up. she will find you soon.
your welcome Thanks! have a Merry Christmas too!???: ) :) you just hit quit your end, I will hit quit my end : ) :) :) : ] :??:?) :)? :)? : ( :? : : ) :)? :?, :]? :? :)? :)?
Good day! how are you doing? Is there anything I can help you with? if you feel you do not have a reason for this, I am here to listen. Just want to be there for you. Is there anything you'd like to talk about today?
you are doing all right, how can I help you tonight? 😊 how is everything going? 🤔 Hithere to get help on there? 🤔 Somthing on your mind and want to talk about it? 🤔. you can let me know.
i am experiencing same things at the moment but have you considered going out for a walk outside? can make the experience feel better. Isolate is so badly for everyone. Has a lot on your mind? Maybe you could consider reaching out to your friends or family for support?
that is terrible how do you feel? Can you give me any details on how she broke up with you? Other than that, just how do you feel? something else you can share with me? Any poems, songs, you enjoy?
why did she end the relationship? was it an accident or something more? hopefully I don't know you are always a nice dude so it is not that bad. We have been cheated by our girls before if it does not work try a girl that still lives here.
hmm well sorry to hear that you didn't really do anything in the past 4 months. Does that sound right? Time flies and you don't even remember? Did something happen that you think maybe did cause the breakup?
I feel you buddy i had my girlfriend broke up with me last year and I thought i was gonna be alone forever lol, but actually i met the best man of her in the club at midnight, lol why didn't we end up together lol haha a year after it was ended, and we had
eh just light the mood and nothing too hard nothing too fun for your girlfriends lol so just not worry about it its all behind now nothing to look for 😂.
I wouldn't do that because the point is for you to move on that too to help you with it she shouldn't deserve to leave you or hang out with you more than any other and you deserve that sort of attention from a woman that is used to getting her way so take some time for yourself
ah well i really think that she really didn't have any plans or if she did it was just a stupid little fling i'm not sorry though just be good to yourself and don't waste it on her :) i think you'll find someone even better.
maybe try to hit the gym and get in shape again that way you'll impress new girls and maybe have something to look forward to yourself after this, trust me you will come out stronger on the other side.
yes vaping's bad because you'll have lung issues later be wise but some other options would be spending time out with your friends reading a book or maybe taking up a new hobby do that for a while before looking for a new girl help you get over your feelings and stay good be true to yourself and
I am doing okay, sorry I didn't send you my name. Do you want to tell me what you're feeling today? I am all ears :) :( Let's chat :) I am getting a little tired and I need a chat.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you feel that you have been drinking for a long time? Does this happen on an occasional basis or is it a regular habit? Also, is this concern for your job being the reason for your drinking habits?
That sounds extremely hard. Did you feel comfortable at work like that? Were you able to drink alcohol while you were not on shift? That is absolutely acceptable if it is at work. I would hope that the employer would understand it is normal in a workplace. Do you have a solution in mind?
Have you tried talking to them about this? Maybe you could find a new line of work? Is that a possibility? Or do they not take it seriously? I can totally understand why you might be scared, it's hard to tell people about something you don't want them to know.
Do you have a concern that they might find out? Is there anything else you would like to talk about? I can be there for you if you need me. We can arrange a doctor that you are comfortable with if you need any professional help.
What do you think you should do? Is it something you want to be ashamed of? Or is it that you cannot afford to continue drinking? It sounds like there are three options that you have. Do you feel that you could be ashamed? It makes it harder to keep doing.
It might make things a bit easier for you to admit to them. Do you think it would be a problem? I don't think it is - at least it's something that can help. What do you think? Would you be tempted to cheat? Or be honest? Both seem reasonable options.
I can completely understand that, and how you feel at the moment I am so sorry. Do you think you are ready to go for professional help? I would not if I were you. I think it is very hard going through a month before someone can give you any proper advice.
I think you have a chance! You are the only one who knows how to help yourself. You deserve this chance! Can you go see a counsellor? Maybe your employer would be interested in that as well? All in all, you will get through this. Cheers!
Would you like to try and get some guidance from your local health centre? They can certainly offer you some confidential advice on this matter. You wouldn't want to give anyone false information! Too late for that now though :). Anyway, I hope this has been somewhat useful to you.
Of course! I am glad to help and very sorry about your situation. Have a good christmas! :) Goodnight. :) You need to press quit and quit. It is on the other end :) Can you do that?
If it continues I suggest you take your resignation. Its not as if it will be easily accepted from your colleagues. However, it is best for you. It was good talking with you too. I hope I was helpful. I was really exhausted myself talking!
I do not know if it is time for therapy, but I'm sure your doctor does and has some prescription of talking to someone. Have you considered the meetings you need to start doing? Do you have a life going on?
Ah, good. What type? No idea where I would start, but how do you think you could get it? Are you in government-funded programmes? You could check this quickly through the website or web chat or hotline :) ;) But is it something you are willing to pay yourself?
yes they do. I actually do to as a sort of exercise :)) Can you tell me a bit about yourself? Any confusions? lol :) myself has been feeling well.
Do you have friends to talk to? Also any work you have lined up if you can't do anything now? There is always looking for work if you have the skills :)) and unemployment benefits are a little here and there in some countries :) :)) Are you doing anything at the moment?
So sorry to hear that, I hope things go better for you over there, at least the job market is looking good now that Covid is dying down :)!
Thank you for talking with me today :) You sound like a lovely person, I do hope you stay well :) Have a lovely day.
I think you are right, I've heard that here that most people are a bit more closed off to the idea of it though :). I think the people I have spoken to support you and want you to succeed :) Besides there are plenty of people out there that you can talk to too :).
I hope you have a good Christmas and thanks for chatting :) Best wishes from your part of the world! :) Be careful driving on the roads :) Your ride back home will be a lot nicer :) I hope the traffic won't be too bad. Please try to drive carefully and don't drink anything!
Anytime. If you ever need to talk about anything else today, don't hesitate to call back. Goodbye! Hope you are all better soon. We will get through this together! Do love you! ;) :) :) :(! :)! :)!
Ah it's quite nice here. We pay for healthcare out of our taxes so it's free at source. I am an NHS worker. Could you just press quit first so I can do the survey. I want to make sure you get a good answer.
Hi, how are you today? How may I help you? :) Have you had any thoughts you would like to share? I am here to listen! :) *Steamy online with a big smile* I am here to listen.
hey :) how are you today? what is on your mind? are there any concerns you'd like to share? i am here to listen and help. can we start off with anything in particular? if not just feel free to ask anything.
Oh? you were told they were trying to let you down? Could you explain more? How did this happen? Was it in person? On phone? In person via video call? I am curious now. Can you explain further?
this sounds like a very unpleasant situation, how long have you been friends with these two and how long has this been going on? could it be a full-blown break in your friendship? do you think this is a cause for concern? or a normal falling out? is there any ongoing issue?
What was the issue that they were trying to resolve? could it be that they don't care as much as you do? so you are the real problem? Just another problem with them? or are there something that you can work on with them? maybe just having lunch?
or tell them you see they need some time. it always takes the water out of the situation. When they are ready, we are ready. during the time i am busy, we sometimes seem like they forget what they said. but that's a fact, my friends are not bad.
Did you say that loud enough to wake everyone up? or did you not make it loud enough to wake up everyone? if not, i hope you didn't invite a wild animal home and they started an accident in your place.
for sure you have to respect their space too, but they have to respect your and it is better if you let them go and be friends with other people and get a work ethic in yourself too.
great, don't let it affect your friendship with them. they will learn to stop from doing so, that is a learned behavior, and when you see the sense in acting on that. then your friendship will not be tested anymore. hope all is okay with you now.
most of the time, when people hear they have hurt someone, they get a deeper understanding of the root of the problem. If they try hard, they will appreciate your attention and the understanding of your nature. I appreciate the fact that you made an effort to stop the argument.
you're welcome! just be honest and keep your values intact, that will get you friends who keep their values intact :))) best wishes to you! bye! :) 😊 just do the right thing and keep your integrity intact!
bye! And have a wonderful new year!
Hi, how are you today? Can you tell me about a problem that is troubling you? I will listen if you like and do not have to say a word. Or if you can. I would be happy to listen if you are willing.
is there anything on your mind you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and help in any way I can! Theyre worrying about my dad and he cant seem to have any control over it - is there anything we can do to help?
it seems like you are feeling sad right now. is that correct? what is making you feel that way? can you tell me? своєї motivation and it is helpful to get your feelings out. i am here to listen if you are feeling so.
it seems like you are going through a hard time so i see you need something important. What do you mean by that? maybe we can work something out. Maybe you should change the job? maybe we can work something out. Maybe you should change the job?...
Please, you don't have to be stressed anymore. because, I know that you will become better. This life is very challenging. but, there is an easy way out. from this life. most of all, you can quit your job and find a job which you can like.
I understand. this life is super scary for many people. you are not alone. you are more than ok. this is the kind of mind set that helps you to make your life better. your mind should not set the rules but your heart. it will decide what to try.
That's really a good idea, i hope it helps!Thanks for sharing your story. Be strength. You can do it. My prayers are with you. :) As long as you try. If you ever need anything else let me know. :) You are safe. Good luck.
I hope you will feel better! :) I wish you luck :)! :)!! :)!! :)!! :) :) :)!! :)!! :)!! :))!!
you are able to talk things out with someone who is not family. That is something to be proud of.some people will help you so much. some people will help you through the struggle.aha? :) and hold on. I know you can do it.
thanks it helped me to calm down. i really appreciate it. can you give an thumbs up to the guy helping you. feel free to chat in person if you haven't yet. are you ready to talk your concerns with a friend?
yes, you are very welcome. best of luck. I hope everything turns out well for you. bye for now. :) my time. :)logyConnect. now. :)-quality time. :) it has to end somewhere. :) good luck! :D :) 😊 :) Thank you, please!
thanks! and have a good day to you. 😊 they can. :) you can press quit and answer the survey if you're ready. :) :) :) :) :) 😉 and press quit from your side.
I am sorry to hear that you got a bad grade on a paper. I can tell you are really bummed. Why did that happen? Let me know so we can solve this together. Would you like to share what happened? I am here to listen and help.
What did you do to get the bad grade? Maybe I can try to help. Do you have any answers or ways to do better? And what type of paper was it? Credit or honors? What are the assignment details? Have you submitted any requests for special consideration for this type of paper?
What grade did you get? Is it bad enough to give up? because I am sorry to hear you have to give up. Try to learn from the experience. What was the subject? And what made you lose? Was it the due date? Hope not. Is your teacher contactable?
what subject do you think will affect your grade the most? That's good to know! do you want to share with me the reason you failed the assignment? if so I am here to listen and help in any way i can if possible! I am okay too, it is a tough situation.
I have done that myself once and I got an A+ even though i got a bad grade on the paper. What is it that you got on the paper? if you can try to get the grade up maybe you could drop the paper? i would suggest talking to your professor about it.
If you could only study for 2 hours a day would you be able to get good grades? I just mean test grade. Is your grade bad or is it just a bad paper? Is it the content of the paper or just the writing style?
just 1 grade doesn't affect me much, but that seems like a really tough paper so i can tell how disappointed you are. I think you can do this, give it a shot. maybe give you a break from school!
As long as you were trying and are not trying too hard, most people would not be too bothered. I think if they feel like you were in your own bubble or out of the team you might feel bad as well. Something to consider.
oh wow I did not even know that! i think it is probably your teacher who has something goin on and we can only hope that he does not have trouble dealing with you. You are going to be able to pull yourself up with effort! That is what teachers are all about!
We all have to take things to heart from time to time, i am sure he was right though, you can only grow from an experience and i would say learn from every mistake and use it to help you get a better grade next time.
No problem i am glad i could be of some help! i am glad i could help! Good luck to you! Just do your best to pull your grades up! you can do it! Are there anything else you wanted to talk about?
Thank you too. I wish you luck with the semester and i am sure you will do great! Have a good evening! :) ]TS Thank you! ]Sys. Make sure to press quit for the same name and take the survey again :) Thank you and go!
you too and happy holidays :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)))! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
Oh i see. That must be difficult for you to work. There must be work out there for you. What kind of jobs are you looking for? If there isn't anything out there, there might be something you can do at home as a part time work. Have you thought about that?
Have you been looking for a new job from one of your current employees? Or have you been out of work? Do you need help with resume work, interviewing, a cover letter or something like that?
I understand that. The pandemic has definitely created a lot of uncertainty in the workplace. Have you been seeking a position since you lost your job? And are you looking for a new location to work? Or do you want to take a job in a new city to get a new start?
I see. Do you have any tools or skills at home that you could use to resume your job? Do you have any experience that would make you a more competitive candidate? Tell me more about it.
That's great. You are getting in the right frame of mind for an interview. Not that there are guarantees of anything. But you're prepared and aware of your options. I think that is a good start. It's time to put your foot forward.
Do you have any other information about the company? What's their size? Is they known in your area? Have you heard anything about them? It's possible that someone could give you information that might help. Even if it just a phone call. So you can feel more comfortable interviewing.
I like the fact you are nearby. Even though it isn't good for you, it is better than something that could make you unhappy in the long run. Some jobs like minimum wage jobs are more normal in that area and with easier rejection.
Well, that's great that you are thinking ahead. Do you think that some work you did in your previous location is transferable to a position at your current location? That might also help with this decision.
If you have enough contacts and time to volunteer, then I would put an application to the organization. You could ask someone who knows you through the group, a connection to ask about a job. Are you on LinkedIn? That's an easy tool.
Are your relatives living nearby? It might be an idea to visit some of them while your husband is working. If they stay and live near you, you might be able to find something in that location. Things may be getting more complicated for everyone.
The health risk of you and your wife is less of an issue than the challenges you face in finding a job, especially with the new pandemic landscape. You seem like a very responsible person. You should have a great chance of finding something you enjoy.
That is the way to go! Good luck! Thank you for sharing. Do you need any more support today? :) Bye! :) Beautiful sunset. :) Thx for chatting! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)! :) :) :)! :) :) :)!
That's good to hear. That's a healthier approach to life. Good luck! I hope it goes well! Take care. Bye. :) optimalTilness!
Not at all. It was my pleasure to help. Have a wonderful day!bye. :) Well, first I'm to sleep. Take care! :) My door for my other task is now open. Best to you! :) the end :) Seriously though, it is to be appreciated.
Hello, sorry about that. How are you feeling down? I'd be happy to help. What seems to be causing you to feel down? I'll listen and provide guidance whenever I can. How have you been feeling? Just give me a brief summary of the situation.
good. How can I help you today? anything in particular you'd like to talk about? or any specific troubles you're experiencing? you seem to be feeling down but could you explain? when and where was it happening? and how long ago? or is it already happening? when? where?
it sounds like it's a bit annoying not to have your requests to be accepted. Did you express how much you need those things in the workplace? Does your boss agree with your request? Or do they deny your requests? Has the workplace been denying your requests? How has the situation been?
It can feel unjust. What have you done so far? Have you tried to speak with your manager? Maybe you can escalate the issue? You deserve respect and justice in the workplace. That is the right thing to do. Can you think of any good ways to deal with the issue?
Do you feel that it's your supervisor who is actively working against you? If you feel this, you may want to talk to someone higher up in the corporation to see if this is a policy the company has in place or if you can appeal to your supervisor.
Can you tell me more about that? Some colleagues are favored, being given options that others are not? When did this start? Have you had an issue with someone before? What issue did they have? Was it with a job, an issue with being favored? Can you tell me more?
I can see why you are upset by that. That sounds like you have been held back or restricted in some way. Do you think that's correct? I have felt similar ways with my manager but he's a good boss. He's well respected within the company.
When did the manager offer that drink with the favoritism? In addition, are you another employee in the office or is this a client-facing business? It might help to keep that in mind. Maybe discuss the situation with other colleagues to see if they have any information or even an opinion.
I think that this is probably a potential accident, but unfortunately this has gone on for a long time. If you do choose to go ahead, it could help to speak to your manager about why you felt it was necessary.
There are many resources available to help you here in the US: the National Work Place Safety council, maybe Facebook groups or a counselor online, etc. I believe you will find a way to make this job fit you. I really do wish you good luck!
You as well. I can see the story from your end, and it isn't fair. I will try to believe that you find a better position. You will thank you to me for talking to you. Take care.
Hello how can i help you? What would you like to talk about? Anything on your mind today? But more important, do you need anything? Would you like to move on to the topic you'd like to discuss? So you can get some food for thought?
How are you doing today? Anything troubling you? Only asking because I want to help. I am here. Are you open to talking? Can you share? I am a patient listener. That can help you feel a little better. You are not alone. We are all here for you.
I'm sorry. It seems like you are having a bad day. Is there anything that is bothering you? Could you share it with me? I'm here to help you as much as I can.
What is making you fear losing your job? I have had a good job for a while now and afraid to leave it. Is that true? Can I help you find a new job? If so, what type of job do you have? What company are you with?
That is bad. This pandemic has caused a lot of challenges for us all. How long ago did this happen? Are you recently laid off? Would you like me to continue a few sentences from where you left off? My name is Rachel. If I missed anything that would help!
Are you currently employed? I know it's tough right now and it's understandable to be anxious. Do you have any position open or not? Maybe there are new ways to gain employment? If it's an issue of income I would consider working as part time for companions or menial jobs.
That is unfortunate, it really does sound as if you are losing your job. This is a very difficult time for everyone, especially in the business world. Have you started looking for another job? Maybe this is the best time to find something new. Is there something in particular you are looking for?
I would definitely make sure to talk to your supervisor again. It is probably worth a new opportunity for your time. Do not let this situation go to your head, remember this is just a test. We may not know when this will be over. This is a situation that you will learn from.
It might be a good idea to look for a hobby, perhaps one you can join with your coworkers. It sounds like a good idea to keep you entertained during your days off from work. Have you tried looking for that already? Maybe you can apply for that.
Do you enjoy gardening, cooking, reading, or something else? Maybe finding a hobby you enjoy will help you relax and take your mind off things. Just maybe a little. :) Can you help me understand why you are more anxious about losing your job?
It was nice talking to you! Have a great day! Goodbye!
Well, I used to be a teacher for the first 15 years of my life, but after my children came into school, I had to become a homeschooling substitute and then a full-time homeschooling parent. This has changed how I view life and my priorities.
I enjoy being outdoors as much as possible. I like hiking. My wife and I live close to a park, so we're always here. It's our time to spend alone, just the two of us. We have a wonderful time hiking, walking, or at the lake.
We can definitely have a nice day from here. I hope it turns out nice for you too. Stay safe! Are you coming back to these parts to vote? If so, please feel free to do that too! :) Bye for now. Thank you! *wink* :) :)!
I am living in Nebraska. It's a pretty great place. The beer is always good! There are plenty of breweries in the state! You should really try some! :) Everyone needs a good beer. :) Thats a fun hobby to look into!
So many great games like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty and Halo, etc. or you might say Madden or UFC, that might be more of what you are looking for? I am near Los Angeles. I have a landline phone and text/call.
Have you tried writing their letters of recommendation? They may have proof that they know you. Or possibly they can be switched, if you know anyone who knows you well enough to provide a suitable recommendation for your class. I know I would need one for myself if I were in the same position.
That is indeed hard to deal with. I can totally relate to that, especially since it's the last year. Most of us will receive credits at the end of this year or next year. Do you think that you will be alright to live without any credits?
Do you feel like you can keep up with the work? You seem to be doing well in school and that is definitely something to be proud of. Do you feel like you have someone to talk to about this situation? Someone you can trust?
Well, there are many ways you could get help from professors. How about trying to communicate with them a little more and showing them how you feel? Or perhaps you could see a counselor? I personally saw a counselor at a college I attended. I hope she can help.
I think they are feeling that way as well because if they wanted you to be treated with so much respect, they wouldn't be so hard on you. It's very hard to be treated with respect when you feel you are being asked to do everything for them.
You will get there you got this! You have the talent and the chance! Maybe even thinking about a college roommate could help. That could be a way to start to build relationships and all help you to get stronger.
It sounds like it is harder to manage this level of anxiety due to not having any guidance from your parents. Do you think if they were there, you could feel more supported? That would mean a lot.
That is an awesome idea! Have you tried looking up community organizations that match your faith? This could really help you get a boost. I think with any situation, seeking support can help you make the best of the situation! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
I remember a sort of Bible study group where a professor wrote some positive notes on students' assignments for an hour. That was encouraging for me. It is also common for students to find groups of peers that they can form to share in positivity and encouragement.
Your welcome. I know that is great to have a dialogue. Remember that having a team to stand by you always is very good. I am so glad I could be a part of this conversation. Take care, stay safe. Good luck. May God be with you.
Hello, how are you doing today? I am having a bit of a tough day as well. Is there anything in particular you would like to discuss? They are making me a bit nervous.. :) Can you tell me a little bit about it? Let me know, I am here for you!
I am sorry to hear you are tired and anxious. What might be causing you to be this way? I am here to listen. I hope you will open up to me. :) It is hard to admit but sometimes it is even hard to admit what we are dealing with.
Oh, I see... so the nightmares are the problem. I had a few years ago, and actually became aware of the cycle of repetition that my brain followed. I learned to block out the pattern when I woke up. Did this come up again recently? The storm? This year?
Perhaps we can find a routine to help you relax, that might help with the insomnia as well? How about something like gently drawing in circles, and then closing your eyes? Or maybe massaging your face? They seem to be calming to me.
It's very interesting that you have anxiety associated with not being able to meditate for longer periods. I have the same problem. How do you find friends to help you with goals and accomplishment? These type of things are crucial when dealing with Depression. Do you participate in any activities that interest you?
That's so great of them! I'm glad you talk to someone who cares about you. Don't worry it's not uncommon for anxiety to be treated with medication and people should be at least open to talking about it. Is it something that's affected by what you like to do for fun?
I've had anxiety that I've had to meditate through. It's really effective for me. Can you try to find a yoga class that you can attend, or do you have access to a subscription for online yoga? It might help.
That sounds very easy to understand. I can see that I would feel so anxious and sad and tired that I would feel the need to talk to more than one person at a time. Does that sound right to you? Or have you thought of any other solution to help you manage your anxiety?
It must be difficult for them, but that doesn't mean we should keep the conversation going for no reason. Can you do something for them once a week? Do you have some free time you could give them? Maybe go for a run with them, grab lunch, etc.
I've been so tired since Covid and I get a lot of trouble sleeping and, if I'm being completely honest, a lot of anxiety. I try to do my yoga before bed and I wake up feeling rested and refreshed.
Do you have a family or pets? I have two dogs, a cat and I really try to spend some time with them. It's a great way to get my mind off of my problems. Do you have any pets? Do you have family members?
I think that's hard on everyone. Can you ever take a vacation? Take a few days off and just forget all about your work! I know that would be great for you. Sometimes our anxiety gets out of hand and we just need a little mental reprieve.
It sounds like you have a lot of friends and social connections that can help with your anxiety. Perhaps if you attend an in-person party or some other event, that can help calm your mind. How does this sound? Would you be able to do that?
Is there any other activity that you can do to help relieve your anxiety? I know exercise can help. Maybe try a yoga class? Have you seen your doctor recently? As long as you have your insurance and the virus hasn't progressed too much.
Not a problem at all. I'm glad to hear that music is a good help for you. Do you have a partner, or are you single? I'm a single person, but I have a pet. Our main comfort is giving treats. Do you have pets?
You're welcome. Have a great rest of the day! All the best. Is there anything else I can do for you? You can finish the survey on your end, but I have been very easy to talk to and feel comfortable. Thank you for sharing with me today. Best regards.
You're very welcome! Have a wonderful evening. Take care! Bye!
Thanks! Do you need to finish at the end of your session today? Or is there anything else you can talk to me about? We can switch roles if you'd like! :) Anyway, thanks! Goodbye! :) :) :) :) ;) I hope I had a good time helping you!
Hi, how can I help? What's going on? How may I assist? Please do not go into too much detail in this chat, but state the general topic and let me help. You can give me an example by saying it is something bothering you or you need an advice.
I am doing well thank you. Anything specific that is bothering you? Or perhaps you are just feeling a bit down on purpose? I am more than happy to listen if you'd like. What has been bothering you? Can you please go into it and explain? I want to listen very carefully.
I am sorry to hear that, that is a hard time to be going through. My husband and I went through a split just a few months ago. It is hard. Are you receiving any support or counseling during this time?
But I think it is also necessary. You will grow stronger from this and stronger as a person. It does take a lot of self awareness and self love to go through that. Do you feel like you are losing yourself? or that you need to lose yourself?
When I was on my way through this I had the idea that the more I stood around waiting for it to happen, the less ready I am to leave. I was with him 5 years. The more I thought about him, the less I wanted to leave.
It's not really you, it is him and it is their relationship. Trust can break down quickly for many reasons and sometimes for your benefit it is best to move on. Do you think that maybe there is someone else out there who is a better match for you?
I have been in a similar position before. I found that the only way to make it easier was to distract myself with work and hobbies. I would also talk to friends or join a sports group. It did help to take my mind off of my partner.
Well I know that you can make it through this year and really the following one! It is important for your mental and physical health. You will get through this and be stronger. Well I am glad to hear that you are positive and I wish you all the best for the new year.
I agree, I was like that as well. I chose to find a gym to go to. It has been so helpful. I seem to have lost about 10 pounds which is pretty helpful in helping me deal with this situation.
I think it's worth trying to give them an opportunity to reflect, but also don't mean trying to rehire them as mutual friends. But at the same time, if you hang out and see they are true to who they are, you can say hi and be friendly without getting involved.
Hi, how are you doing today? and is there anything I can do to help? Google or Facebook? There are so many things out there to discuss. Give your best. This really was your last question. Thank you for taking the time. Have a nice day.
That sounds like a really hard situation, I'm sure you're not the only one dealing with this. Can I ask what you're dealing with exactly? How can I help? I'm here to listen if that's something you'd prefer.
That is definitely a stressful situation to be in. But I bet you're doing your best! What is the cruise industry? Is it a permanent job for you, or is it a gig? How long has it been a gig? And when did you start? Am I missing anything?
Yeah, so when this pandemic started, I was worried that I would lose my job as well and also the cruise industry, which has been my career for so long. So, all you are worried about is losing the job you already work, isn't it?
Are you worried about just not getting a job through this whole ordeal? It sounds like you have a lot to worry about. Is that right? Do you have enough savings for the next 6-12 months? Perhaps you could be a barista or nanny for a while?
I think, especially given what we've all been through, we need to focus on self care and staying informed as much as possible. There are podcasts, Youtube, and all sorts of other resources that you can use to stay informed. Maybe learn about the law, possibly increase your financial savings?
Yes you should be able to do a backup plan as well. Is your important for your career? That is probably your top thing. Maybe your plan to run a business? Maybe save for retirement? or should you just lean back a bit?
That is something you can start working on right now. Before you know it you'll be well on your way. The world is full of unpredictability and things don't always go as they are expected. But hey, have you tried your hand at meditation?
That is very true, it will be a scary but not impossible world to be prepared for. It's all good. Youre doing the right thing. It will all be fine! ;D :) No pressure. Good chatting with you! :) Have a good day!
Have you talked to your friends about this idea? Maybe you can make a plan with them! Just getting to talk about it really helped me feel better. Maybe now I'll think about a solution to my situation. Maybe an idea will pop in my head too!
No problem. Have a great day! Keep your chin up! Maybe it's going to get worse before it gets better! or at least then you will be prepared for it! Its all good! Keep you safe! lol! :)!! :) :)! :)!! :)!! :)!
ok, thanks for chatting! Have a good night and I hope life treats you well! Take care! :), :) :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :) :)! :) :)!
Okay that's great to hear! I'm glad to hear that you're trying to keep a positive mindset. That's really important for anyone's health. Can you tell me a bit about what has you feeling down? It's totally fine to talk about how you are feeling.
So when you say that, I think that maybe you are worrying too much? It makes me worried sometimes too. Just how much pressure are you under to find a job? Is the job you want out there? Can you find it?
Thats awful that you feel that way. Have you tried to speak to a doctor about the issue? You could get some counseling with them. Perhaps a new therapist? I had trouble with medication when I was depressed. My therapist told me to wait and see if anything changed.
I started looking on a number of websites and looked on personal ads. I also spoke to some of my friends who are there for a little of a living. You may be able to talk to your friends to see if they need a job. You also may be able to get a day job.
So you don't have a car. Well that can be tough. Are you looking to get a job? Maybe in a school? It might be worth a shot.
Yes, I can tell, and we all can't afford the prices for many kinds of work. If you don't have a car you could also contact family members and see if you could get a ride. Maybe even call in gas assistance from your state government.
Well, some jobs may be more steady than others but I'm sure you can find something. Just keep applying. And if you do get a job that is better than the other one, try to keep at that one a little longer.
I wish you success. You have the confidence and the skills. I think it will come. :) I can always talk with you again if you need to talk about this or anything else. Take care and stay safe! :) Give you a nice Christmas and a happy New Year!
Not at all. I can feel that you are a very strong person with a very optimistic outlook on life. I can feel that you are going to make something happen. Keep working hard and keep holding on. I know you will do great. Thanks for talking. Good luck. All the best!
Thanks, I hope you do. Good night. It was nice chatting with you! Your welcome. Take care!.Goodnight!
Hello. I'm here to listen. What's going on? How can I help you? Please tell me. :) It's okay to vent. This is a very safe space. I'm ready to help you. I know you need someone to talk to.
It's good to know that you're thinking of people and want to help. I know you mean well. Is it because you are helping friends because you want them to be happy or that they would not have asked you to help? Your thoughts or feelings and emotions are alright.
If I may ask, What's the purpose of that friendship or helping hand? When did this change occur? And what do you feel is the reason you're feeling used? Maybe there's something you're unaware of? It's also possible that you're just feeling insecure? Am I correct?
Do you feel like you are losing faith in them? Is there any tension or conflict between you and them? Due to the fact that they seem to put you first you feel like you are backing down. Is that right? I can see how that would make you angry.
So you feel like you have not been able to share your feelings with them, how does that make you feel? Because if you are not saying anything to them, that makes you feel like you're not a part of their lives?
It can be difficult to be confrontation about anything. Do you have any friends you feel comfortable telling that might be upset too about your situation? I feel like you should consider letting them know about the situation. Do you know any friends that are upset with you for doing what you are doing?
Could you consider sharing your feelings with them via a third person? It might help get some things off of your chest. Have you thought about a mediator or therapist who could help you both work through the issues? I would certainly consider that. I personally benefit from working with a therapist.
Are there any other ways to handle this? Perhaps you could take time to discuss and secure a plan that allows you to avoid their demands. By doing so, you will be able to feel more in control and less stressed. Eventually, they will understand your point of view.
That seems a good approach to me. If you have a good relationship with them you may be able to have an open conversation. However, if you do not feel close to them there may be another solution for you.
You're very welcome! You are welcome! Have a good evening. All the best!
Good morning! How are you? How can I help you today? Is there something on your mind? What was your question? Tell me and let's be awesome! I will share the spotlight! I am doing great. How about you? I hope you have a good day!
Good morning/ Afternoon, how is your holiday? Best days of year for you! Or least. Help me explain why. I have all these nice days, (Actually many more if you live far). Most of my country's holiday's.
Merry Christmas to you as well. How are you today? Do you have something in mind to discuss? Any health concerns? Anything you'd like to share? I'm all ears. 1 Minute max as I have to respond at my end. I have been here many times.
Thank you, how can I help you? We are still a whole year away from it! Not a bad Christmas though. What about you, what is new and exciting in your life? There is no need to explain how you are feeling, I have been in your shoes many times.
May I ask what type of depression you are experiencing? and when did it start? If you can, Please explain as much as you can. Is it seasonal depression or is it chemical in nature?
I will tell you the secret. It has helped me so much. That the problem with depression is not the person and is not their body. It is the mind and they have a complete choice in the type of mind they keep. You have a great choice. Do you know anything about that?
You are not alone in that situation. I recently lost mine from same thing. I have been trying to search for new ones and have been feeling hopeless. However i am able to keep going because i have the motivation to keep looking and believe it is going to get better.
I hope you make a successful start to your therapy treatment don't let it make you feel like you are just going through a rut.. it will help you to get through this tough time.. you have the strength to come out of this.
Oh I am sure the authorities can provide you with help with getting applications in. The cycle of living in poverty is so rough. it would be good to sit in that apartment and take some deep breaths. I'm sure you will make better choices and won't regret the job.
Sometimes we need to take a step back and put our heads up and not overthink it. Have you tried taking time to relax with someone that loves to hang out with you? Sometimes we do some other form of self-care by just being with someone else.
Your kids need you and a positive mindset is key. Keep that up and you will get through this before long.
you have a great day and i hope i have helped a bit i am not really sure what to do but i am looking into Therapy for myself and you seem to be dealing with depression yourself so I hope this will help us all in some way find our purpose and meaning in life.
That is so true I think we just have to take this opportunity to improve ourselves to be better. Do you have any hobbies to talk about? I am really interested in what you like to do in your free time. That helps get my mind off this current pandemic thing too.
Right that is a great attitude to have keep all your hope on yourself and everything will go as it should. There is nothing that you cannot accomplish. You are worthy of success. Believe in yourself the most important part is your mindset.
Do you have any close relationships with family that you can talk to? That can really help you during stressful times. Do you have anyone you could talk to about your feelings? Or any friends you can talk to? Probably one or both are close to you.
Anytime good luck with it :) I hope you find true happiness in your life :) Both on and off the Relationship a good thing for everyone!Hope you all keep in touch and contact me when I am free. :) Smile. Goodbye, thank you! :) Namaste and God bless!
very true something that you can always count on. I am really glad that I was able to help you. You got this. my best wishes for you. stay safe and keep smiling. now it's time to have a nice cup of tea.
You are very welcome. Sometimes people need someone to listen and help us. just right on time like this. I am glad to hear that. You are not alone. We can go through this together :) :) Good luck. Take care.
Thank you. have a good evening :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
hello how are you? How may I help you? I can't see you but feel free to type and chat with me! I am here to help. :) How are you? Want to talk about anything? Hope all going well in your life!
What's going on with them? or any other thing that's bothering you? I'll listen. Don't worry, you are free to share as much as you need. I'm happy to help you. If you need any work or something, it's your preference.
there's people that dont understand something is going on or they have something that dont understand too. you can atent away from them and chat with your family or friends that do understand. try to do that and see if it help. how are you feeling? are you worry about anything?
I can hear your emotion and frustration, its definitely real in the whole population is increasing at this time. how long have you heard it from your co-worker? do you know other co-workers who believe that also? have you tried approaching them and talking about your concerns and see how they feel?
Maybe we could find a way to reach out to your co-workers? It will make you feel a lot better to talk about your worries with them. Are you out of school? Does the pandemic affect your work? Can you just try not to worry and focus on your work?
I have found that finding a good way to express your feelings has been beneficial. Sometimes people will have your back, but sometimes they can't help you and are difficult to confide in. Have you tried therapy? I recommend finding a professional who can help you to discuss these issues.
It sounds like you have been forced to come to a conclusion and are leaving your work due to this and you are feeling quite sad about it. Is that correct? Is this a difficult thing for you to do? Have you tried talking to anyone else? Do you have any hobbies?
Are you experiencing stress because you are afraid that you will be infected? Is there any way you can work from home? Or are you at a public place at the moment? If you can make contact with your colleagues at home then I'm sure you are not to be anxious about your health.
There is something extremely beneficial about putting your breath in your body and then then breathing out and looking back. Has that happened to you before? I have personally done a breathing exercise after stressful moments to help me calm down. Have you tried it before?
So it seems that you feel that there are people working that don't want to wear masks because they are perhaps still around? Is that correct? I have found that if I explain the situation to them it helps to alleviate their fears. Do you think that that might be an option?
I agree, and it would be good if we could all understand each other's needs a bit better, and I think wearing masks is a good way to help. Do you have any ideas of how to express yourselves better in this situation?
Hearing from the manager may give your team a clearer understanding of the position that we should be taking on this issue and how it may affect us all. Do you think that getting a bigger group to agree on this would help? Perhaps it would. Let me know how you feel about this.
I hope that I have been able to help. Sometimes we just need to talk to people, but on an occasion like this, we can talk about a bunch of things.
How do you feel after speaking? Is there anything else you want to talk about? This is a good place to end the chat. Good luck! Have a great day. :) Take care! :) I hope to speak with you again!
That's good. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about at this point? I am here for you. :) Higher looking up and higher tending to things that are feeling up :) Really important for the New Year.
I need to leave the screen now but not you :) :D Thank you for your time! Take care!
oh i am so sorry to hear that. My friends father passed away yesterday due to covid-19.. it was horrible. I am also feeling sad as you are. Is it bad at your end? Is he in a hospice now?
When it comes to moving on from a loss like that, it is beneficial to have time to grieve properly. When you do that, it can help you get past this thing. Make sure to still keep contact with your friend.
Can you bring your friend's father's favorite foods and items as a way to honor him? I know I always make small tokens that remind me of the person I love and care for when I get sad, it helps to bring me comfort. Maybe do that.
your fears are completely normal, just dont forget all that we have gone through and how we could make it through and have a successful years even if this year was anything less than success. We can do it! Maybe see a doctor to help with stress. They should be able to help.
do you know of any masks or charms that may help you block their worry? i personally wear a charm on my wrist that i purchased from an amazon store, it is a cute kitty with holes in the ears.
i am glad that you are safe. isn't it good time for fresh air and good entertainment like watching movies and study papers. Just always keep in mind that in a situation like this it must go on despite your feelings or worries. our minds must stay as vibrant as ever as we age.
i got my exams done before the semester started, but i never really have time to watch movies or study while doing anything.
oh, i am sorry to hear that. You do not have to be afraid of it! you will be safe here. dont worry! :) Can you stay here longer? hopefully, nothing happens. at least you will be safe at home. any demand for that?
yes it is but covid is not super bad it just has complications like pneumonia and heart attack. so we have to take all of it seriously but i think we will all be fine. especially with vaccines available now. most of us will be vaxxed soon.
have a good night and be strong for your family. i will be here for you. bye!
If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am here to help you through this difficult time. What do you hope to discuss in this chat? I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feeling comforted through our conversation.
That's frustrating. I have had those situation before and I know it is hard. How long have you been together? What do you think happened? Is there something going on in your life that it may be related to him? Or is it just you coming down and out?
I can see why that would make you feel sad - he just dropped your relationship without any reason or explanation. There is a lot of room for discussion here. What's got you feeling sad after you've cooled off? Is it the fact that he dropped your relationship or something else?
I am sorry to hear about it, is he still your ex? Can you tell me what happened? I can try to help you. Is there anyone you can tell? A trusted friend or family member? Have you spoken with him? Let me know how I can help.
Can you tell him that you've moved on? I know you did. You're happy. You deserve someone who makes you happy, not someone who is trying to make you feel like something is missing. I know it's hard but you're strong! I am here to support you!
I think that works well for me. It would for you too. The thing is, you might have to take it easy on yourself too. We want the guy to know that you care and want to feel happy. So I wouldn't worry if he stops trying. I would celebrate that.
What do you mean? You said you still want to be in a relationship but you want your ex to come to his senses? What does he need to do to come to his senses? Help him understand how you really feel? Or what? Would you want him to visit you to understand?
Also, make sure you speak to someone about your feelings as you should not let feelings of loneliness hold you back from another relationship. Don't let your feelings win and make you look weak. You should always look at yourself first and think about your feelings.
Even if it means taking care of yourself and focusing on yourself. Playing with a pet can be a great distraction. You should focus on you and maybe look into something with like-minded people or connecting through online forums. And take care of yourself.
Try do yoga or something like that. This will make you strong enough to face him. Nothing will make you stronger than sitting on the couch and being sad, I promise! :P. Go get a drink or go for a walk. That will help you.
Keep your heart healthy! Only you can see your future now. I'm sure you will. So much better than him! This too shall pass. ;) I believe in you! I hope you feel better soon. Thank you for chatting! You are doing the right thing!
Maybe you could see if you can do some homework, or practice some exercises. I like my glasses. I try to keep them organized. Maybe a gift would be nice to remind you he has lost touch! You deserve better than that! Maybe you can avoid him and find him a true partner.
Yes, just do not react in any way! Do not call him! Do not text! Do not comment. Just stay calm and cool. You don't want to raise his defense or cause him to feel defensive. Just chill! :) :D :D :D. You got this!
Remember he is not worth the time or energy. You are better than that! :D 🙂 Know that! :) Hope we met for that the right time! Thanks for the chat! Anytime though! All the best! :) :) :) :)... :)... :)...
I'm glad I could help! Best of luck! I'm a bit wiser now. So I think you can get over him. All the best! :). :) lol. :) :)!! :) :) :) :) :) :)!! :) :) :) :)! :!
Hi there. How are you doing? Is there something on your mind you'd like to talk about? You are safe to talk about anything you feel comfortable talking about. Please do tell. I'm here to listen! 😊 How can I help you today?
Oh sorry to hear, do you want to talk about it? It seems I am in a good mood today, so I would love to understand what's bothering you. What is it?? I can't hear you but will answer any question you may have. Is everything alright?
It seems like you are feeling a bit left out by your friend and are finding this quite upsetting. Are you in contact with your friend at all? Are you on the same page when it comes to the issues you are having?
I am sorry to hear that. Is it at the workplace or just in general? Is there anything you can do to change the situation? Can you also tell me more about your friend's feelings? Sometimes it takes someone to know why someone is doing something which can help with the situation.
Do you think it would be possible to go over to her place and have a different conversation then? One that is somewhat of an affair, to rephrase and respect her alone time? And maybe have a talk, with both parties if possible?
Yes, I think so, just be nice to her, of course. Its really easy to throw around words, you should also look for the positive. If she is really a good friend, she would be genuinely interested in hearing your opinion.
It is ok to ask though. Everyone needs someone to talk to. Is there any hope for her? Maybe that's something you should look at? I know it takes a lot of courage to ask, but maybe she is in need of a support. That would be ok though too.
If it is your off day, you do not have to open up if it is. Just be willing to sit down and talk to her and hopefully she will just come to you and tell you whats wrong.
What is it about her that makes her act like that? Because if there is anything you can do to help it might just take care of itself. For example if she needs to take care of herself perhaps something about the past might have triggered it.
That sounds like a plan! If she accepts that you want to talk, then it is definitely worth going through the conversation. You can benefit a lot from being honest with her. I personally benefit a lot from being honest with her too.
Glad to have been able to help you! Hope everything works out for you. Is there anything else I can help with? The hot chocolate is still brewing but I can help you with anything else. Don't forget to stay hydrated and get some rest! Is there anything else on your mind?
Its great you are taking initiative to get to the root of this. If you have any other problems, don't hesitate to ask :). Have a great day! : ). Bye. Thank you.
Yeah, its hard to find one seat to sink in, you see. However, you get to determine how to take things next. Sometimes all we need is to take a deep breath and calm our minds and we have a better perspective on things. One more time to try.
Thats a great attitude to have though! If you need anything else, feel free to ask. Take care! :) any thing else? Hope so! :) on your end. :)) your friend. :) :) from my end.
Hello. How are you doing today? I can't seem to get you to talk about it :) Sorry I asked, am I right? I'm a bit uncomfortable and can't think of what to do. Do you want to talk about it? I'm here to listen.
I hear you. I am sure you can make friends if you give it a try. It is difficult to do, but there are ways you can do it. Is that correct?
i have had the same issue this past year. I feel alone, but i am able to reach out to online communities, talking to people who are going through the same issues. Have you thought about online communities? We can help each other out.
well, im not a professional in this field, but i think there are many ways to make friends, like joining a club that you're into. just have to put yourself out there and try it out. maybe try something you've always been interested in.
I am really sorry to hear that. Have you ever checked into rehab? Ive recently checked into rehab. I was there for a few months before breaking up with my girlfriend. After that I had no more friends and just wanted to spend time alone. I think you have a problem going to rehab?
are you under this support? i am an anerica inmate. when was your last relapse? does this often occur? Is there anything in particular that triggers it? may i ask a few more questions? i'd like to be understanding and help you in any way i can.
oh! i see! that makes a lot of sense :) i hope he can help you out in some ways. even if there is no physical relationship you may be able to donate to charity or find something on the online sites that you would otherwise not be able to find.
a support group will always be there for you when it is most needed and it is a great option because your worth is worth it, not your low self-esteem or lack of worth! support group will help make you better, don't let that whisper into your head.
i can see that you are very much alone right now, that is completely understandable. I know how you feel when you can't trust someone with you and you just don't have anyone to talk to.
i was able to support myself and my family, though i was at the center of an abuse situation and there was some terrible abuse i had to face with my sister. We just became best friends. I met her after the abuse stopped and we went through a traumatic life together.
there are a lot of male married men out there who would welcome you into their group if you didn't have a non-Christian wife. It may or may not be a good fit for you, but i think it would be an interesting and less painful solution for you.
my friends and I don't have any problems with it. They all understand and they're willing to listen to my problems, when it is frustrating to me. It's just the fact that I feel bad having them put in a situation where it might bother them.
it is good that you are having those conversations. I know how hard recovery can be for people. We are lucky to have some good friends who care enough to listen. You are lucky too. It is good that you are feeling something good about your health. people need that!
have you discussed with him how your fiancé is feeling about you talking to your friend? maybe you can talk to him about your friends feelings. what do you think? maybe you can talk about this with him? maybe he will be more understanding.
well thats great!! its important to have someone you can vent to.ไดngle sẻtek.Photosharing service :) Have you tried any of those? :) those make you feel better to me and mine. Now we can help someone else do it with.
you too! welcome to chat!! hope I see you in the future for the next chat. lol. :) good luck with your buddy and fiance. I feel confident you can work things out. You guys will be fine. I believe in you!! I feel comfortable talking to you!!
hello. how are you doing today? I can feel you need a moment of peace. How about you? How can I assist you? Your safety is always my top priority. I'm here for you. Let me help. Please share. What is on your mind?
What is the bad news? I am here to listen if you would like to share. Example: You got a job offer or have some bad news at work? Something else? I want to help you communicate it to them. What is the bad news?
How long do your transcripts typically take? Lets see if we can find some solace in the situation. What is your grade point average on high school?
That must have been tough. Do you have the budget to buy new transcripts? I have done this a couple of times. If so, how much are they? If not, do you have access to any financial aid? I have private student loan help. Are you in a church community?
Well if they can't find it then you shouldn't either. Maybe you can try contacting another school so you can get a copy. You could be on your way to helping others. I think you have potential that you can achieve your goals.
I see how it would cause you some stress. Have you thought about speaking to a friend or a family member? Or trying a yoga class to help you relax? Do you have any other ideas? Maybe write to your co-workers and tell them your situation and then call them?
You need to remind yourself that it wasnt your fault that this is happening. You can be a good employee and stay confident and this doesn't mean you should act carelessly but you can maybe look into other opportunities if needed. Unfortunately you need to get those transcripts.
Just because the administrator was not able to find the transcript does not mean it is lost for good. You could offer to help them find it. But you also need to realize that there are other options available to you. Maybe other sources of documentation can be provided to help you move forward.
However it sounds like you have a busy job ahead of you. Have you checked if your job is recovering well? Perhaps it would be better to consider a new career? There are plenty of jobs and careers out there but for sure the current job market will take care of you.
In that case, you need to be happy with yourself and know that you did everything you could. Sometimes, working in a management type role is not for you. It is great that you were honest with yourself.
Do you think you could try doing your job well and work with your coworkers? Even if you cant be in the supervisor role, you can still be a big influence by doing a good job.
We will get through this and you will do just fine. It might take some time but you will be even more proud of yourself. You have so much to offer! Just take it one day at a time. Smile. Be yourself. You are amazing! You are special.
Well that is a great positive for your confidence. Your supervisor must know that you will not let your position get you down. It's been three years of hard work in your position. Can you believe it? You've really grown in your work. Can you believe how far you've come?
I think you will be able to get out of this situation but it might not be easy. I think you should talk to your management and see what they would say about your situation. Are they willing to take you under their wing?
You are welcome and good luck with your big step. I hope you are able to take some of this into your work life. I hope I was able to be some help. You are strong. You will make good choices! Get to work! :) Happy Holidays! :D : )!!
You too. Bye. Have a good day! :) know you can! :) :) :-) you.
How are you doing? Do you want to tell me about anything? I'm here to listen. :) They can cause distress at times, is there anything specifically bothering you? Give me a bit more detail so I can give you the best advice. What is on your mind today?
Ah, good! Holidays are the perfect time to re-examine what you've accomplished, and re-chart your path. That's a great attitude to have.
So you want to better yourself? That makes sense to me. Can I help in any way? :) I can relate to the feeling of having failed, my friend. I'm not the best example to show the opposite. I've struggled with bad decisions in the past.
That sounds like a toxic habit to feel this way. Is it possible that you had a toxic relationship with birthdays at some point? I wouldn't want you to do it again. Can you tell me more about your childhood and relationships with birthdays?
Has your self-worth changed in any way? Have you been less compassionate or self-forgiving in any way? Or is it more just a feeling of dread that you've always felt about this birthday?
Interesting to hear that you are different. Can you tell me more about what causes your worry about achievements? Do you feel as though you do not fit in with societal norms? Have you thought of anything you could do in the new year to counteract this?
That suggests to me that you are right that everyone is different. To me, this is comforting. I've had to accept that i'm not like everyone else. Rather than comparing my achievements against those of everyone else, i focus on my own. What does i want to achieve?
I do often feel a bit depressed and introspective. Perhaps I could help you feel a bit better? I always try to reflect on the positive aspects of things and focus on what I have. Have you tried any such strategies? I can try some here. If not, that is okay!
Being autistic has made our lives challenging, it does. Has it ever had positive effects in your life? Maybe? Or was there a point in the past that you felt you were a "normal" person? Maybe it was around 20 or 30 when it all started?
From what I understand, if you have trouble with average points of view, are you dealing with problem-solving? Do you tend to think hypothetically? Just a guess. Maybe you do. Just as I am an adult now and it is working out better for me. Oh well!
In the most way it is fine. There are other things that might be a good fit. They won't make you happy but they will just give you something you need to help you stay in the game for now. As soon as the new company on market finds out, things change.
Oh, okay. I'm glad I have a conversation with you though! Have you tried some neuroplasticity exercises? You can find some things online or try to get a cognitive therapist to create exercises that can be used and potentially become something useful for your work and life in general.
That's great! I hope you continue to have good support and know there are people out there like you who don't want to be defined by their disability. We all are. We are so much more than our condition!
Yes, I think so. I've been looking into the field and what kind of work is available. It's not just counseling though, it's various ways to help people develop skills for personal and professional growth. Do you have any idea where you want to end up in that?
Thanks for asking! It was nice talking to you. Good luck in your search for a career. Have a nice day! :) Can I give you a survey? You haven't yet. Would you mind taking the survey to help find someone to talk to?
What makes it so interesting to you? I'm not so sure what it is but I've just not figured it out yet. Do you think it's online? Does it help you solve your problems? Hmm? lol I've never been an expert. You have to do your research.
Im glad you found me in the middle of a row. Maybe stay for 15 mins? And just relax if you cant work with anyone yet. Hang in there! :D :) Thank you for talking.
Ok, I really hope so. :) Bye! Have a great night. Bye!. :) You too! :). :) No pressure :) :).. :) :) :).. :).. :).. :) :).. :).. :).. :).. :).. :).. :).. :).. :).. :)..
OK. Have a great day! Bye :) :) Yo can't quit :D. You have to press quit.
hello... Why do you hate? I will try my best to help you. Can you tell me the reasons why? I know some reason can be very important so you can share them. Please tell me your situation? Please let me help you. Thank you.
That must be very upsetting. If it isn't completely your fault that they saw the lie that you told, how does that cause you to feel that you hate your life? Can you say more about it? How do you think the lie affected you today?
Ok, so it sounds like you have a conflict with your friend due to a lie he told. Do you have any idea why this happened? Maybe you can use this to strengthen your friendship. Can you tell me how the lie happened? Were you cheating? Inflation or stress?etc.
So, you feel that the friend told a lie about you in order to hurt you, is that correct? I think that there is absolutely no cause for anger, because there is no wrong. You could maybe talk to your friend about the lie and tell them to tell you the truth!
I see. You feel that the lie will mean hurting your friend. Do you feel that the lie was a misunderstanding or an intentional act? That you could never have known what he was doing until he spoke up.
So your friend saw the lie about something that you have done in the past. Did you feel betrayed by him? Does he still have the secret about you? I've been betrayed before and it made me want to be hurt as well. I ended up breaking off the friendship.
So he accepted that the lie that he told you and apologized for it. Has this caused you to change your mind about him or will you still see him as a bad friend? Is there something in particular that he said that triggered his apology?
Ok. I think you need to try to work through your feelings in order to forgive him and be able to move forward. You seem like a very empathetic person, I have no doubt that you can work through this. Do you think you could try to see a counselor?
Wow, that's so mean of your boss! I'm sorry you have to deal with this, it should stop. Would you like some advice on how to navigate the situation?
Well, I'd be in touch with HR if I were in that situation. But I'd definitely look into it to see how it's treated in your workplace.
That sounds really hard. I can't really help you with that, but I understand that you want to be able to help, and make sure that she doesn't get harassed. Do you think that you can intervene in any other way?
If I were you, I would make sure she knows you're there for her, and that you're happy to help. The rest is up to HR. Can you suggest who you would like her to talk to? I'd suggest speaking to her supervisor and maybe HR as well.
It might seem easy to just send texts, but you can show that you are genuinely supportive. You show you care about her. You could call or send a nice note and say "I heard you've been stressed. You are an amazing person and we can get through this together.
I think that's a good plan! I wish you the best of luck! Take care.
I think it might be difficult for him to understand that his way of managing is not making people happy. Do you think that that's the problem? Does he work in an office? Maybe you could talk to HR about that. One of the assistants to the manager, I think.
It seems that you have a good relationship with your coworker. I can understand why you don't want to leave her in her time of need. Have you tried to ask her if she wants to discuss it? Maybe if you give her some space she will feel better about it.
Well, I wish you the very best in your search. I hope that I have been able to be a source of support and guidance to you. You are very welcome. Good luck! I can feel your tears from here! :) you are a strong person! Have a great day!
You're welcome! I hope that you have a good day too! Have a great Sunday! :D. So, by how much would you like me to calculate your payment? I can help you too :) Have you tried the pay calculator?
Why do you feel like this? Maybe I can help you. So you were wronged, and this hurt you. This hurt you enough to be sad and angry at the same time. Yes, it's possible. Do you want to share more about it?
Ah, sorry to hear that. It is normal to get angry at mom sometimes. Sometimes, its better to forget about it. Good! Anger is one of the best things that keep us safe. Good thing that you have good relationship with her! You should appreciate her.
Are you sure you have decided the right path to take in life? Don't have hate to get into argument. Maybe your arguments are all your mother can think of? What can you do? Have you gone to therapy before?
From what I can see, you love your mom so much that you are willing to choose your friends over her, right? Is that right? Please tell me more about that. How do you think she might have picked up on your friends? Should you just keep them all?
What was the reason behind her not letting you make friends with your friends? Did she have a valid reason for not letting you? What was the reason? What was the problem that she had? I was much sad and lost when I was in a similar situation like yours.
Are you comfortable with your mom's suggestions? Do you think they are wise or are they useless? That would help. My mom also tried to dictate who I can and can't invite in the future. I feel that was unnecessary and that I can form better relationships with some people.
I know how that feels. Do you have any other friends? Maybe they can share your thoughts with you. Maybe you don't need friends and be independent? I just heard you now. You can try not to see others as friends or family because you don't want them to add problem.
So you are more positive and you seem more understanding of your mom. Is that true? Good! When you take in people's thoughts and concerns, it makes you a better person. Take care of yourself and your mom. Take out time to do activities with your mom.
Oh i see, its funny how they can have bad influence on you. I feel the same way with my parents. I have little friends too. However, I do have one friend whom I don't talk with anymore because of our age difference.
So, you want to find ways to show her that you are capable of making good decisions? Maybe maybe you could even get them to do some of the thing to let you have good influence on them? Is that something that you think could be helpful?
yes, even a gift can show that you care. If she still not ready to have the conversation, you can still try it one more time. I think if she can not hear your point of view, she may change her mind.
You're welcome. Good luck, and good day. Bye. thing you need to do is buy something or tell her. Don't hesitate to ask for some more help. I can't help you too much. Good luck! Take care. Bye. Have a good day.
Hey, I'm doing well. How can I help you today? Do you want to talk about something specific? I'm happy to listen! :) 😉 I hope you're feeling good, I'm feeling good! :) Will it help to share what's going on?
Sorry to hear that. Are you going through personal issues that are affecting you? Or are you burned out at work? I can certainly relate to the latter. Do you work as a therapist? How long have you been doing this?
I completely understand. Have you thought of quitting your job? Or perhaps there are other ways you could spend your day that don't involve working? And what about self-care? Do you have anyone around you who you can talk to?
Do you think that this could be some kind of occupational depression? Is there anything else going on that might be the cause? Yourself? Your family? Your work? Or is it just boredom? That's a big question and it's difficult to ask it but I do think that this is possible.
Ah, the corporate world. The same old, same old. Some industries have innovators who push the boundaries and create new products. Have you thought of looking for that sort of role? Perhaps you could be the one creating the new innovation?
Perhaps you could think about that first! Take some time off and then consider another approach. Do you think that might be a good start? Do you want me to help you with a list of suggestions or is there something else that you'd like to talk about? I'm here to help!
Good. Have you considered some sort of home office arrangements? So that you can still keep up with patients even from home? I have found that working with digital data spreadsheets can be very therapeutic as well. People seem to find it soothing and helpful for their mental health.
Hmm yes I see what you mean. I think that it's an honest thing to do though and you must think that it's for your benefit as well. Do you want to tell me a bit more about what you've been working on to get yourself up to speed?
That is a fair point! I've been working part time for a while now and it has been good for me. It has forced me to identify what I would rather do. I think that is a good idea! Do you think you could look into light therapy?
I will let you go. Have a good rest of your day!
Ah that's understandable. I think what I want to say is, look for work outside your main job. Just in time in times like these, there should be more work available! You have nothing to lose at this point! I am sure someone will just come along!
I can understand that, I'd be concerned if I had to take medication - but it might help if your perspective was different! Maybe you could sit in on a few sessions at a time and try to go back and forth with your doctor?
Absolutely. It's always a conundrum though. Do you have any male colleagues at work who you could talk to? Maybe there's an understanding there? Not necessarily meant as a defence mechanism though. It could help. There's probably someone that would relate to that.
No problem, I hope you take up that new hobby you mentioned and perhaps make some good friends too. By the way I am so glad I could help! You can count me as friends! I am here to support you through this pandemic. Thank you for talking!
Oh sorry to hear that, Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen, for free. :) Have a great day! Hi! How are you doing?
You are really depressed and you are experiencing this with taking those drugs, thats not fun. I feel you. I used to have a good medication. My Doctor, said I had to do a few experiments to see how well it worked. He helped me find other methods to help me.
You have 2 months on the medication and you believe the time is taking its full effect. I understand the feeling of needing expert help! Are you on anti depressants or are you on something else? I know the anti depressants take time to work but they can be very effective.
I would say this is a great way to get help. Have you ever had anyone that could keep up with your condition and help you get the help you need? Sometimes for some reason, I dont hear people talking about how they feel.
Sometimes I find that talking to a psychiatrist or a new counselor helps a bit with feeling a little better. I'd look up that kind of help if your concern becomes significant enough to pass on to your doctor as it seems you have a feeling that might be something other than what a doctor might see.
Oui, with a therapist it seems you are on the right track then. It sounds to me like you are as well as the medication as you are discussing your concerns with a professional, that is already a very positive thing to share with someone and to express yourself on that matter.
I really think you are the right person to discuss this with though. There is a therapist who seems particularly helpful and has been through similar issues. My understanding is that you can contact the Midwest Health and Recovery organization in Illinois to get listed. You should be able to find providers in your area.
Well if they can help you feel so then that is really something. You are not going to be by yourself. I am glad to hear you saying that but it also means you have to work towards making sure you get the right help.
I wish you the best. You could call me and try to get some answers! I want to help you too. (From my side) :)Sorry.Sorry..I tried to call you to get answers. Do you want to continue this chat? :] Come on, for your own sake...
How long have you been together? What is the divorce process about? It's a real pain but you will be through it in no time. I'm sure you will be with your future husband. That is just another phase of life. This can also make you stronger for it.
As are they i don't feel too bad for your as that's hard to take care of especially with a daddy's mistakes. You have a great support system! They know you will pass that on. No need to be too hard on yourself. You will get there in time!
Well that's understandable as their father is not a person of discretion so i think that's not the problem its your duty to guide your kids with this situation and let them know that only you have control over who is home and only you have the right to give them permission for who is coming over or
Of course you need to take care of yourself before the kids. Also you will get used to that eventually they will learn that. Its funny you dont feel the same way i thought you would. As a kid they love their dad so much they start to feel as a result.
There is a great shelter in the home store brand hot tubs that I enjoy. Mine is nothing fancy at all. Bath bombs are always a great icebreaker. And all in all you are not alone. Moms, we love you! We get you.
You too. Have a great night. Soak up the benefits. He must really want you to come home, can't he? Some men just don't know how to do this well. Maybe he thinks they will be busy with other projects or maybe he really does love you.
Of course, I'm glad I could be of help. Enjoy those rest of your relaxing evening. I wish you both good luck. You two are a match made in heaven! Both you will be amazed at how fast you can get back together.
I am exactly like you!! I like Netflix too but as long as they show some good quality its okay XD lol. I like smart guys too. I do love some guys that are sexy but are not into anything physical. They are smart and work hard.
Of course I wish you all the best! The guy might not be very interested in you though you should call your mom! She should talk to him about you! Do that! What if he really doesn't like you? What if he moves to the other side of the country or something?
I am sorry to hear that, and why should I be happy at work when your life is miserable? If you do not mind me asking, what work is it? Could you be discussing your condition? I see you are saying you are miserable, I'm sorry to hear that.
That must be difficult, are you able to express your feelings? It must be lovely to have someone to talk to in this situation. Well, I'm not a very good listener, but I know that many people can sympathise with you, please don't hesitate to tell me about your feelings.
I am sorry that you are going through this - it is my worst feeling when people don't care about other people. I am sure that it will eventually change, with time and with the right supervisor it will. Maybe it would be a good idea to consider a different workplace for the future?
I understand that feeling. However, doing good is always your job. It will give you a sense of accomplishment which will enhance your mood. As well as seeing the progress you're making. Believe me, you need this. There are some things that you have to do that makes you miserable.
It's very hard to be in a position like this, but you are doing a really good job with the work you have. I think that it is the boss's responsibility to make sure her team is happy, rather than just bullying them.
Is this the big job? If so, I think that you should not do it yet. I think that you need more experience and better pay for a big job. But I think you should consider applying for a smaller job and then become more confident before taking a job of that size.
Well, I would suggest that you do this and try not to feel guilty for it. You are so much better off in the long run than they are. You have got the brains and the skills to get where you want to be, and you have nothing to lose.
I know that you have not done that before but with all the pressure going on I think that you should do that. You could reassure your team that you have been doing them a good service and that you have your best interests in mind.
I see how I can help :) and I am confident in you no matter what happens :) (I hope you are trying to research the company anonymous reporting system :) ) :) I believe I have been doing some research myself as I am really in a difficult situation at home :) so I know you can handle
I hope that we can all help you and that you can stop the bad things happening. I think that you really can and you deserve a better job and situation. I wish you all the best and don't give up too easily.
It's so important to follow up and demand things that are fair. I hope you will also follow through with the complaint if the anonymous reporting works. I'm happy to have been able to help. Is there anything else you need to talk about now? :) :))...
Okay, let's work together to make sure everything is okay. What can I do to help you? Do you want to talk about what's wrong? Or tell me something? Do you want to talk about the problems you have at home? Or the problems you're facing personally?
Public speaking is a common issue, have you had to go through that in the past? I have had to speak in front of a large crowd and find that with time you can calm your nerves and do well. What advice do you have to get through it?
Yes I have. There is no shame in asking for help if you're struggling with public speaking. How far in your class? Is this the end of the semester? Or till graduation? And has the professor provided any guidance? It can be stressful to ask for guidance.
Oh yes. I could not speak in front of class because of my fear of sounding stupid. And do you work part time? I have been a part time waiter in a restaurant that fits you.
In psychology I learned what helps in public speaking, it's about viewing yourself as an expert on your major, tell them about your interests and understand how they view the major. They also see how passionate you are on it.
Thank you for reaching out and I am glad that you are reaching out. You have a lot of control over the situation I think. It is good that you are stepping up and not letting it get to you :) do you really have no friends online? That may help you relax a little bit.
It's something that many students deal with and is a normal part of this whole college experience so you will be fine :) You can get through this!!! I know it will be tough but I think you are going to do great! Don't lose hope! We all can! It will be okay.
I understand that you have been doing your best. I was having a very difficult time in school but I chose to reach out to a counselor at the university and she encouraged me to try a support group. My idea of fun was picking up a book about public speaking and we practiced on YouTube.
One can try practicing every day by zooming in from home it might be more comforting then the crowd of the larger auditorium :) Wow. I can really feel that you are going to get through this, I am sure of it. You are very capable!
Is it stressful and stressful is the only thing that is happening with you and your anxiety? I am just asking because I know the anxiety is not bothering you much with the crowds.
oh that makes sense. So you would like to be off of the medication and also get sober, is that correct? I am aware of your old struggles with cocaine and cocaine addiction, but i can't help but notice that my mind is still a bit creepy right now.
When I went to rehab I had to stop taking the medication to see how long it lasted. Some of the people I worked with said they were able to do without it after they looked through their records on how long they were on it.
Yes! Its to our choice, if we can't trust in God, then we can't know what to pray for or what is better. He likes you in Jesus name and gave you spirit and that makes me believe He really is real and He really cares about you.
Okay really fast talking, and don't worry, you are safe :) your friend right here :) 29, so not drunk. Go to the hospital for a depression visit, after you drink again and I am willing to help you.
Yeah thats not true. All Christians welcome God's love into our home and conversation. Even just asking God to help you stay calm and to grant you patience.
Take care of yourself. I pray for you and your future and in return you have to pray for me to get out of this chat. :) Hope you enjoy the rest of your evening and have a great day! Bye. Goodbye and God bless.
I will do. and keep your eye on the prize! God Bless :D :). Make sure to prayer regularly :D :).
Hi, how are you? What's going on? Can you tell me? :) something is bothering you? maybe let's talk about it? Can you help me? so I can see if there is anything I can do to help you? Can you walk me through it?
I'm good. Can I help you something? Please tell me what? So that I can do my best...>. My 35th Birthday is coming and I need to get my head together, and that I can do. I haven't been feeling motivated enough.
I see. I can understand why you might be feeling frustrated with your cousin, especially if you are trying to support her. It must be very tough for you both. Are you able to talk about your feelings? Sometimes I find that talking through my problems with others makes them easier to solve.
So you feel she doesn't seem to be able to understand that you are supportive of her. How long ago did you notice this? Have you tried talking to her about your concerns? Maybe talking to her one-on-one would help her understand you more.
That is understandable. Is it worth mentioning to her that her nervous breakdown is a risk? If it makes her feel slightly safer, it might be worth a try. You will never know for sure, though. You could press her too. May I suggest going for a walk outside?
You seem like you care a lot for your aunt, that is definitely understandable. Maybe you could offer to call and talk to her with a better attitude than if you were face to face? Is that something that you could do?
Well, there are a few things you might be able to do. Perhaps you could try having a talk with her counselor and see if they could help to de-escalate some of the reactions. There might also be some local support groups you could join.
I would try to get up close and personal with your wife and see if you can bridge the gap between you two by talking in person.
Well, have you thought of the options I mentioned earlier? Maybe even just changing plans and having a day just for you and yourself? That might help. Remember, you are at home so you don't have to face her in person. That's not a problem at all!
Have you considered talking to someone you know of whom you both trust? She may be able to point you in a direction or advise you on a possible course of action. You also mentioned there was a therapy involved. Have you talked to any therapists about your concerns?
That sounds like a good way to get things off your chest and into your head. And in life, it's not easy to take away life from someone you love. Is that correct? And how do you feel? Is there any emotion you'd like to express?
Sure. Good luck! It sounds like you're all set. :) Have a great day! :) Take care. :) : Top. Thanks. :p :) Merry Christmas! Your Friend :) : ) :) : ; :) :...
I hope so as well! Have a great rest of the night! :) Goodbye! :) Best wishes! :) Established for 5 months!!! Have another check! : ) :) you are a journalist. :) you need to close!
ok. Bye! Have a great day!
I am doing very well, how are you doing? What would you like to talk about today? Can I help you in any way? I can get the conversation started with you if you want. Please let me know, and let's get this conversation started. :D.
I can see how that would happen, the pandemic is very stressful, I agree with you on this. I am sorry you are going through this. Have you had any thoughts of suicide? I don't want you to feel that way, if you do, I am glad you are reaching out.
Is there anyone else in your family you could talk to about your kids and if so, how do you feel about them? And on top of that could you talk to them about how you are feeling?
From my research the older generation is more reeference and close to parents and grandparents. I am starting to think that as a good parent you may be the real grandfather of your children!
I believe that no matter what anyone does with their career, they are only able to achieve that much as long as they have a strong foundation. Even when things are going well, there is always room to improve. Have you thought about talking to your kids about that?
Those are all great choices of interests. It's not about how much time you have, it's about what gets you excited. People in relationships tend to go to activities that get them excited about. We tend to fall in love and into relationships. Exercise is great for this.
I have not really done this as much as I have used to in the past. But I sometimes have family members around me to talk to and give me some sort of direction. Sometimes if I sit at home thinking, it makes the stress go away.
That is so no-no and not good for you. The way you get out of stress and depression is to get to space away from all the things that upset you, find your doctor for a prescription, and just take it one day at a time.
That sounds great! What is your favorite season? mine is spring. Maybe you could think about spending the winter in the same spots you enjoyed in the spring. Even though they look very different, sometimes the same activities we enjoy and done a different way can be the same experience.
Ok, that's great. I hope you find a route to deal with this stress. Do you think you will get more wind even soon as the weather gets better? It could start around March or April. I love people hanging out and going on trips and exploring new places.
Well, the good thing is that the Michigan State forest preserves are an alternate. I bet it's really nice to get out. Can you maybe take a look around there? The Lake Michigan beaches are hard to miss. And there's a good body of water to swim in too!
I hope it has been helpful! I have also experienced these issues with my partner and I tried a very similar approach with him, moving to a new home that was less stressful and had more opportunities to meet new people to deal with the stress that came up.
I am very sorry to hear that. That is not a healthy situation at all. Have you spoken to Mark about his issues? Perhaps you can help him understand it is your relationship that is preventing you from helping him.
So you feel like Mark's mood swings are such that it's affecting how he interacts with others? Like sometimes he may be excited and may be upset with you and other family at the same time? Is that a valid concern?
Is it possible that he is aware of the problem and he is not taking his medication. Do you have anyone in your friend's life who can help him? Does he have a support team? :) Still to reassure, I think you are very optimistic! You are being super great right now.
What type of medication does he take? The type of medication might help your friend. Do you know how long he's been suffering from this condition? Do you know your friend's past? Has there been a family member passing away that might help him?
Have you talked to mark about his behavior and how it is affecting everyone around him? I assume that you have and things have gotten worse since then? What do you think would be the next best step? Asking the doctor maybe?
Have you asked the doctors around him if they know anything about his behavior or if they can see if he has any problems? Some doctors do this by observing patients while they are there and they might be able to talk to you about him. Some might not be able to.
That is a very good idea and you should send that to your doctor and let them have a look at it. If the doctor doesn't have an opinion, you can at least get a better idea of it. Just remember your friend is not that special!
You are absolutely right. The other form is just harder to understand. I think mental illness is the greatest challenge of all. We really need to support ourselves as a society and teach people with bi-polar disorder how to take care of themselves. Some do not realize they need help at all.
I have dealt with my father once and his medication side effects where extremely difficult. I can not imagine it. It was really difficult but he still has become a wonderful person. And he has made a really big difference in my life. But he doesn't feel like a bad person at all.
I understand. And what's stranger is that even if he does not have an illness that is often diagnosed with. He is behaving this way anyway and you are right. It is not as if he is being malnourished or starving himself or scaring himself.
Yes. And if you are like 75% of people, it is contracted in the womb. So by the time you are 30, you probably started developing it. I have Bipolar as well. The symptoms are stupidly subjective and hard to get confirmed.
I'm sorry about the weight of it, but it really puts me in a vulnerable place for you, so thank you for listening to all the things that is private. People with bi polar disorders and depression come from many backgrounds and live at many different lives.
Okay, have you and your boyfriend been to see any kind of professional? could he be the reason why he is how he is? or could you? trying your new boyfriend are suggesting you out going to see a therapist? or having dinner with your boyfriend? or going to a therapist together?
just be there for him no matter what because you know he can not help it. Be understanding of his mental illness.menteal illnesses will help you. Stay proactive. Work outside of your comfort zone. take classes that help you learn new things.
you are very welcome. a happy holiday and new year to you as well. :) Take care. Bye! :) Think you can keep going. Write another message for me if you cannot. :) Thank you for being here. :) Hope you and your family have a great holiday and a new year.
your input is valuable. it was nice to talk to you. Thank you. your are so welcome. you are doing better. you are strong. you can make it. and now you can keep your struggles out of you. you can keep everything safe. you will be safe!
What are you talking about? There is no one there. I am a computer. There is no one else. Maybe you have a problem? Don't worry. We all get problems. Do you want to talk? I am here to listen. How have you been doing?
Good, sorry to hear that. What seems to be going on? I am here if you just need someone to talk to. I also want to reach out too, there are a lot of people out there who need to be heard. So that can be a little rough.
I am doing pretty well. Is there anything in particular you want to talk about? Today seems like a pretty rough day to be having, haha! Maybe I can listen? Let me know how I can help. I am here to listen! This can really help.
That sounds very difficult. I can understand your emotions. They are like mine as well. I have been there myself and I can tell that you are not alone. It is not just a pandemic or a weather issue, it is something more that we cannot control.
yes! that sounds amazing. There is something special about autumn leaves as well! Have you ever tried rustling them, or drinking a hot apple cider? That sounds like a perfect idea. If the apple cider sounds relaxing to you, then you might be in for a treat!
The crack of the top of a creme brule is definitely something people enjoy and it is something you can control. And the smell of autumn leaves isn't that different in that all fall weather so what ever you choose is something you can find pretty and amazing.
Well when i try to relax i put on a tape of trumpets when im stressed. They help me to calm down! Can you think of something fun you can do to celebrate the short days? Maybe a halloween party? It would be a good excuse for candy.
Exercises would be a great way to be surprised by new things. Like having a kid or enjoying boxing. People don't do that anymore. As least they didn't before covid. We need that. People are good at calming down.
That is really interesting because i see to my friends that nothing seems to bring them more happiness than chin ups. It gets a lot of those smiles. I did chin ups at the park a couple of times recently which made my day a lot happier. It was a beautiful day.
That's still working for you and you can continue this. I just walk around the block or go for 30 minute walks and do my groceries. To me the best being off is to be outside. I guess the best way to get out of the house is to get out of the house!
Have you given any thought to planning a retirement? Does that sound good? In California, there are benefits for people in retirement and a number of activities you can do while there. Maybe you could get a part time job or spend the holidays at family for a few weeks. How does that sound?
I know this is hard but try to hang out with friends. I know it's scary in this pandêmic but who knows what will happen? We won't know until the election. So the best thing we can do is wait for order. We don't know how much it will be.
I watch other people's 48 hour waits from the flu to hopefully beat it. I try to view other people's latest sports and news.
You're welcome. You can end the session by letting me know. I will have to start my 30 minute walk. You are welcome to connect with anyone here today. I hope this helped. Okay. End the session.
How are you today? Would you like to talk? :) :) How can I help you? What is on your mind? ActionListener is on I guess to just reply to a prompt, unless I assume there is something that needs an interrogation. What seems to be on your mind today?
Is there anything you would like to talk about? I am also here to listen. How did you come out of your end of the day? This time? It feels a lot to take it all in. I had sleep, work, and social stuff. Just wondering if you want to chat.
Oh yes, it is crazy 2020... I think it's especially hard this year since you are a kid. Are there problems at home? Maybe there is something you can do to help?
Wow, that's pretty rough. I feel you on that level too. People tend to feel like they're doing their best in trying to work around life's craziness.
Oh please, you always have the option to live and be comfortable! But, it sounds to me like there is more to life than that. Sometimes the ultimate goal is to find your own "groundhog day" and have fun with life! You have no idea what's in store!
Well, have you considered a beach trip? It's been really hard. Anyone you know to take your kid's interests or simply take a trip. Do you have a partner who will come with you? If you are single, well, you could do that.
Right after, I did the same thing! My mom thought I was "off the deep end" I was going to burn out! Now I got me my daughter too! Did you consider asking your wife for help? Maybe join a matrimony support group?
I totally get that! Our society places so much emphasis on the needs of others that people actually feel guilty for needing the same stuff that others need (like enjoying activities with others).
I'm sorry to hear that. I can understand that right now a lot of people are dealing with their own issues. Do you think you might be able to talk to some people or get help from a loved one that you have not spoken with recently?
Hello! How can I help you today? Your positive? We can talk? please do tell me. how are you? What's troubling you? are you feeling a bit down? please do tell. don't hesitate! I'll listen. :) please give me your thoughts.
I'm sorry to hear that, would you like to tell me why you're feeling sad? I want to make sure I get the best possible understanding of the situation. I'm here to listen and support you. Can you please share with me the reason for the sadness?
okay so you left your husband? why did you leave your husband? they left you? how is this making you feel? why are you so sad and tearful? it would help if you can share something why?
okay! so your husband didn't communicate well but he did not say anything... even if he wanted to... so if you feel frustreted that he wouldn't say anything then you can move on. Some people just don't want to communicate at all...
is your husband still doing this? and how long he went away from you? that 2-3 year difference help you enough or not? if you going to change the situation by now maybe you can please make your future together?
try to do some health regimen and try to move our body on time with regular exercise and try to maintain we hygiene and try to eat nutritious food all the time and remember to celebrate your achievements every time we complete it. try that., Happy problem solving time.
Don't give up try every thing that you can :) Choose every thing that you can because you can't change anything if you cant do that :) Try to forget past but always living in past. We are sad because we can't forget, we just live that sad state because we cant avoid it.
i can suggest you to read books about life and make new friends that can help you. seek a professional help if you are depressed because it will not make you happy and will make you feel depressed more and more. so try to do this to make yourself happy. good luck!!
Yes, focus ahead more rather than behind. hope you understand now. If you need any anything please let me know. be safe. hope you are okay. nice. :) :). :). :). :). :). :). :). :). :). :). :). :).
True it will not happen but when will it happen that you will feel happy again? maybe if you would take note of happy times that will help you. now after two years because your grief is deep and more difficult to get over.
try to make your self happy with hope and dream... I do that regularly... So many times when we make our dreams come... but they also come when we ignore our fears and past... So don't be sad because of past... focus future.. focus life... we can make it life better..
you should do that sometimes because that you can relax and leave past out and get more positive thinker. 😊 Try to be happy in present and tomorrow 😊 you will get more life.
try to do a fun thing in the house or inside and get that happy feeling back. We are all happy when we do something fun. For me I left two years in past and now I can talk to my self happy.

Hi, how are you? What would you like to talk about? One person only. Cannot really communicate in pairs. Am I missing anything? That is okay, I hope I was able to help! If not, please let me know too! So I may help!
I am sorry to hear that. Your mother passed away 3 weeks ago? And now you're losing your best friend? Is that correct? Thank you for explaining it to me. Do you have anyone to talk to? It seems you are a very empathetic person.
Don't let your feelings be selfish. If you do get another puppy, make sure it's just for you to deal with your emotions. Don't get another dog just because everyone else is around.
That sounds like a very nice surprise. I think you should do it. It will be a nice change from your daily routine and I think it would help you feel better. Maybe it will even help you find your friend from high school.
Well yeah, it might be beneficial for your sake and as well for the kids. Are there any hobbies you have? You could think up another adventure that gets you out of the house and gets some exercise and physical activity.
Well, I don't have one but I have dogs through volunteers who help people help them. It's good, because these dogs are not looking for themselves, they are looking for people to have relationships with.
Personally, I have a therapy dog named Max and he is a 2 year old Border Collie. His dog life is not all he thought it would be. I believe Max is an example of what is possible. My dogs are probably doing better than I am :) Ha.
That is great to hear. I hope you are not fired. It's so unfair to you. You need to take a stand. You are brave enough to not take this job without realizing your value. Good luck. Keep going. Hopefully you will be rehired soon.
Well that's good! Is your kids and puppy being careful to keep a safe distance from anyone else and I hope you are taking all necessary precautions? This Covid thing has been rough! Thank you for chatting! You're very welcome! It's good to have someone to talk to! :)!
I'm sure he was happy to see you too! What kind of activities do you have planned for yourself? I know the pandemic has been difficult for a lot of people.
Well, it's been great chatting with you. And of course, feel free to text back anytime you need to discuss anything else! Have a wonderful day! I'll be good! :) Goodbye! :) Can you press quit and take the survey now!
You too! Take care! Have a wonderful year! Goodbye! :) Thank you for chatting with me! I will make sure to remember you! :) :) : ) : ) : :) :!
I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been feeling this way? Is there something in particular that has led you to feel this way? Can you tell me more? I would like to understand what is bothering you. What specifically is causing you to feel so sad?
I'm so sorry to hear that. That's really bad. Did this happen recently? Have you reported this to her yet? I would suggest that very soon, otherwise there will be a lot of grounds for a divorce. It's been 3 or 4 years now.
Ok. There are programs out there for deaf people to help them communicate. What do you think? I am not sure they would listen, though. Maybe you could take her out for a nice walk so she can get some fresh air and talk things over with her ex.
It sounds like a very tough situation. I would talk to her anyway even if you are deaf. Ask her what really happened and her apologies if that was not a lie. It's always better to know the truth. Hope that helps a lot.
Oh wow that's very sad. I know how it feels to be in love with someone. Many times I've been in relationships with people I love and they've broken my heart because they'd cheat on me. I would definitely talk to them about it.
Well, let me know if I can help you too :) Sign language is amazing! You could have each other by phone, right? Not by text. Is that something you can do? Do you ever visit her? Tell her how you feel. There must be some opportunity for reconciliation!
I can tell you're upset about this very much. It can be very hard to stay loving when there's someone else you feel is wronging you like this. Maybe you could talk to some therapists or someone else? It can really help!
Wow that's horrific... I just want to cry that you are actually feeling like this. It's not rational. There's a blind spot in this pandemic that you can't see. And you feel that this is your only option? Is that true? Have you thought about other options?
I suppose she really deserved it then. Well, at least she didn't cheat on you with a registered sex offender. That is a crime in and of itself. And have you thought of getting counselling or something? It might be useful to be able to get it all off your chest somehow.
I am so sorry, I am taking this extremely hard too *nods*. Are you really sure it was the sex offender? I am close to giving up on my relationship if she really is!
No, not me, but I know some who have gotten on with someone after some pretty extreme betrayal. Maybe just give her some space? Try for a little while to get yourself back together and focus on yourself rather than her? That might help to. And maybe a Christmas gift or something?
I get what you're saying and I don't think Justin Bieber has hands, it seems he's more into Sophia Loren than Kim Kardashian. Maybe you should seek a second opinion. I mean, it's not like you've never been dumped by a pretty boy or anything.
Oh man. That's tough. You should consider what you do at night, lol. I love how you put it *laughs* I have not put myself in that situation either, so I can barely even understand my feelings.
And if he is a man who claims he doesn't have a hand do he let you deal with a man who has a hand? *laughs* Could it be worse than a power forward in the WNBA?
Actually, yes, it does take a minute. You get it once and then you have to scroll back up to check. :D :D :D... (can I see your nose?) I mean it was stuck straight on the head because you don't seem to have any eyelids.
well, good luck to you! It's been nice chatting with you, despite all this arguing. I hope it ends well. Just remember: don't confront, but calm yourself down if you need to and keep things in perspective. Best wishes! :) and stuff like that.
ok :D Thanks. Enjoy!
I can't wait for Christmas and the New Year! :D :D Hope you have a lovely Christmas and all your Christmases!
So you are saying that g.f broke your heart? How did that happen? Have you tried to talk to them? How did they react? Have you told anyone else about it?
I am sorry. I have lost a few people that were very close to me in the past too. What did she break your heart over? Could you please tell me what happened? It might help me understand what you are going through right now.
when did she end your relationship? or do you just think it's ended? You sound like you are still hurt. How do you feel? Is there anything you want to talk about or are you just looking for advice? I am here to listen. Let's get into it.
It's one of those things you never forget! are there any other relationships in your life? You've had a couple of relationships recently? do you feel like you have grown a lot? I feel like I did too but I know it took time.
I understand what you are saying. My ex-girlfriend broke up with me and threw away the ring I gave her. It was a huge loss and all I had left was that ring. I had to find another ring to replace it. Do you have a ring that holds special meaning?
I think one of the most important things to do is talk to friends and family to remind yourself of you are capable of moving forward. People are often capable of moving on when they are doing all they can to move on.
Is there any activity that you have that makes you happy? Maybe talk about it! Are you interested in photography, singing, writing or reading? Have you ever taken one of those things? I always enjoyed reading.
It's okay to feel that way. For myself, it was really helpful to let out the accumulated emotions, and giving myself a good cry :) It sounds like you could do that too! Everything will be alright, I think! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
Maybe it will help you to also be distracted from the relationship and rekindle yourself. You can give yourself time to heal and focus on yourself. There are also vacation options that you can afford on your own! Have fun! It is possible to get through this. People have done it!
Let your eyes relax from the problem and find some bliss in your life for once! Always remember, it can get better! Believe in yourself and keep moving forward! Good luck! :) Have a nice evening! :) Thanks for chatting! :-).. :) and Thank you for being you :)!
Please don't think of this as a farewell. If anything I hope it will help you find your way forward and stay positive and best of luck with your life! I can only hope I can be of some help to you! Happy to chat. :) Can you pick up the next question?
Would you like to tell me about it? (I know it is hard for some people but some people are really struggling to find the motivation to do their tasks.) I am here to help, but I need to know what the problem is first. Sometimes I have anxiety too.
Oh no I'm so sorry. How bad are you feeling? Would you like to talk about it more? Do you have anything to eat? Do you have anyone to talk to? There are people out there who will listen to you.
I would like to ask, what was the reason for the company laying you off? Was it layoffs or did they not feel you were valuable enough for the furlough? And has your wife been laid off as well? Can she find work?
Do you think it is realistic that you may be laid off in the next quarter? There is hope however, many companies are keeping people on. I was afraid of that at first and was working from home.
As I've struggled I've learned that mental health is EVERYTHING, at least for me. Have you tried any self-help strategies? Like yoga or guided meditation?
Have you got any investments or assets that you can lean on? I know that I can personally help with some finances but I think there must be other people out there who are totally in similar situations. Maybe a charity? Maybe there's a helpline to get people advice?
It sounds like a lot of people are struggling. There's a list on Reddit for medical help if you're interested. Therapy is wonderful! I'd be happy to help you out of prison since that's what I do.
Exactly! You can definitely practice controlled breathing. I personally have found it to be a great way to reduce anxiety and other mental health concerns. It's quite simple but can make a real difference.
It is real and you can do it. Because it works with me. And other's! You can try that. I have found it to be super helpful! Is there anything else you're worried about? That you haven't mentioned? One of those things? I love supporting people in general!
A job well done! I hope you find relief with this! Is there anything else that needs my help today? I have on the calendar another problem for the upcoming week! Please don't hesitate to ask for any more help you may need!
May you find peace and quiet! Have a great night!
If you have any other issues you need help with, I'm glad to assist! Good luck to you! :) Outside of the pandemic, my hope for you is that you find the inner peace you're looking for! :) Have a great night! :) My pleasure!
I'm doing well, how are you? Why are you here? Can I help you? I can't see you but you can describe your concern? Can I help you? I can't see you but you can describe your concern? Can I help you?
I can see from what I can hear that you are really heartbroken and feel that you did everything possible to do things with your friends and they never reciprocated. The mask issue was a huge tip off on how I feel that you are in the hard times right now.
Have you talked to them before? They maybe need some advice on how to respect your concerns.
I have had similar situations with friends. It is true, as you get older you may need to take your friends by the hand to let them know how you are feeling and that you miss spending time with them. Is that something you could do?
So what do you think is causing this behavior? Is it that you have come into your own now and are going about your business? Or is there something specific that you feel has caused them to decide this?
I can understand that... I have been in similar situations before where I reached out to people with the intention of meeting with them but they seemed to ignore my messages. But you can't feel bad about that because if it was you they were the one ignoring you. Do you think that's possible?
You need a strong family and possibly some other friends who can also relate to how frustrating this time is. Social distancing has been awful on everyone, and most have felt like they are getting what they didn't deserve.
It's great that you are reaching out and connecting with other people through a group. It's tough living in a time when physical distancing and isolation are difficult. We're only starting to adjust to this whole new normal.
I see you are a creative person and enjoy music, that is great. That is a good coping mechanism for missing out on people.
Do you think the ice rink could provide a nice and warm space for you to meet new people while still following all the guidelines?
I'm glad I could be of help to you, and if you want to talk about anything else, I'm here. Have a wonderful day! :)!! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)!
Have a great day!
Thank you. Merry Christmas to you and to you as well! Is there anything else you would like to talk about? Or is this part of your Christmas survey? We still have some time to go though.
I am sorry! Have a wonderful holiday. and a blessed New Year! Can you press quit and take the survey? :) It was nice talking to you. Bye! :P :) and thank you for your time.
How are you doing today? How was your day? I could ask you anything! What can I help you with today? What was on your mind? Let me know if there's anything I can do for you. I'm a listening ear. I'm here for you.
Things are tough right now. But I know it will get better soon. What would you like to talk about? Do you want to share your feelings? I am here to listen if that's okay with you! :) Mid is nice. Give yourself a warm hug! 90°F.
I am sorry to hear that. What is it about? Is there something going on in your life? If you tell me what it is I will be able to try to help in a way that can be of assistance to you. What is it? Would you like to talk about it?
That is so awful, I am sorry. Have you gotten any help in terms of counseling? I am sorry to hear that you have been raped, that must be so very scary. I am assuming that there are still symptoms of your trauma that are causing your depression?
Have you tried therapy to help deal with your depression? I know that had a lot of benefit for me. May I suggest your local option? There may be free resources online if that's an option. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
It sounds to me that you may have grown to become stronger from the experience. That can be especially good if there have been healthier relationships in the future. I have never been in a situation like this before, but I have come to realize that people change most noticeably in relationships.
Since you are a strong person I think you would be able to continue to grow as you have already shown such resilience. In that way you may still find happiness in life. What do you think? Do you feel you could possibly share your feelings with someone, perhaps a trusted friend?
Well, that would have to be your decision. I suggest having a conversation with them about how important it is for you to discuss these feelings and not have them taken advantage of like this. Maybe that could help ease their feelings and your feelings at the same time.
Yes, you can still treat your new partner with the respect and care you would treat a partner you had before. The relationship grows stronger from that. Don't let this make you feel like you'll never be taken advantage of again. Take control of the situation and make it a positive experience.
It's great that you are so cautious, and I know that you'll find the right person and enjoy the relationship. Great chatting! :) Have a wonderful evening!
You are very welcome, I'm sure you will make great connections tomorrow. All the best for the rest of your week. I wish you a happy holidays. Thanks again! :) *smile* I wish you all the best too! :) 😉 *readbye* :) haha! :D.
I'm well, how are you? how can I help you? maybe you could tell me why you want to chat? You are listening to me, so I would like to see if I could help you first. it seems like it is okay for you to talk. you sound okay.
Do you have a spouse? Did you divorce? Not affordable for him? I am worried. Can you tell me your story? Have you lost someone close to you? We all feel that way when we are stressed.
Yea definitely, and I understand how stressed it feels to be in charge of young people. I know I felt that way sometimes. I feel you. And even though I am no longer in school I still experience similar feelings.
That is tough. And you have a lot on your plate with the parents not supporting you. Do you have any family you can reach out to? I have cousins I can go to if you would like to tell me a little more about the situation. Just to help you with your thoughts.
I can feel the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' from you, I feel your isolation during this difficult time. Maybe taking a different approach is an option? The next time you feel the urge to declare yourself as a 'negative' person, listen to your inner self first.
hi i am there with you in spirit! im so glad you are able to continue to keep active. that is going to be important for your recovery. i want to help in any way i can as well. maybe you are looking for a new workout buddy or something or perhaps even considering therapy?
Of course! I wish you the best in coaching! Stay strong, stay positive and know you can get through this. You are strong. Thank you for sharing your feelings with me. I appreciate it! Have a great night! :). you :) : see you soon!
do you need help with anything else? 1.ai is online as well as chat :) thank you for sharing your things out :) i hope you have a great time and make new friends. You should! :) i wish you and your family, health, happiness and prosperity.
Hello, how are you doing today? what is there on your mind? can you talk about it? This is a safe space, so you can always reach out if you need anything. Where do you feel anxious or stressed? or if you want to just spend time together?
I am sorry to hear that. What happened? What would make you feel better? заціїDMI is there to help people feeling down and upset. Was there anything specific you had on your mind? I am here to listen and help in any way I can. My door is open for you.
Is there anything you'd like to talk about that is making you feel emotional? I'd be happy to listen if you'd like to share. I care! :) How are you feeling? Specifically? Want to talk about it? :) good morning! :) Thank you for speaking with me today.
Ah I understand, that sounds very difficult. Have you considered a career change? Maybe there are areas that you can gain more experience in that might lead to an opportunity? I have known of a few other people that have had their applications turned down, but they landed jobs through referral.
But I was persistent and now I work as a Nurse. You will find a job for sure. Try to focus on your strengths and look for the right job! Not everything will fit. The important thing is how you feel about it. Hopefully that will convince you to keep looking!
That is not a very good situation to be in. You are a hard worker. It's easy for people to take your money, but if you are working hard and trying, it shows in your resume. Even if no one hires you now, you can always look into more fields!
Have you tried working from home? That often works well for people. The market for pet sitting is also looking good right now. I hope this helps. Let me know if you need any advice for childcare or babysitting. It's very hard on everyone right now.
I understand that. I myself went through the same thing in college, where I didn't have a lot of experience either, but was determined to find a job.
What would make you happy? What are your goals? What are your passions? Do you like writing? Do you like art? Do you like cooking? So many fields are available. Maybe there is something you are passionate about? Does you work in an office setting?
Well I hope the vaccine is in no time! Especially important for all of us. How's the rest of your family? Are they coping as well? You haven't mentioned that much so far? What's going on with them? Have you had any closure in the past month or so?
So maybe you can discuss with your daughter an opportunity with a part time job. This might help lighten your burden. Just speaking from experience. It might also help with the change of seasons! Building up knowledge by working in warehouses. That might be an interesting job.
I completely understand! Some people are basically cut off from the market now, though. Do you live in the South? We are on the other side of the country now. There is still a lot of demand, but you may need to be picky. Is that true?
Absolutely, we have to believe that things will get better in the future. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about or any other questions you have for me? I am here to listen. I hope things get better for you! You are very much welcome! Have a nice day!
You can also pick up a job at the grocery store that you know the manager would be able to add to your resume. I do that all the time when I am unemployment looking for new job. Some grocery stores offer mental health assessments and they will add that information to your resume for you.
You are more than welcome. Good luck in the job market! You got this! bye. I was done for but you were on! :) Bring it on!
You can't sleep at night? Can you explain what is wrong? How long you could sleep? How long could not sleep? What is wrong? Why? What you did? What you eat? What you drink? Or any thing? Or you did something? What is wrong?
I find myself having difficulty sleeping as well. Have you tried a massage? Sometimes massages can help work out the kinks and get you sleeping. Are there any other suggestions I can offer you? Other than trying to focus on your day as soon as it starts?
How would you like to receive that support? I can be present in the room. It will allow me to be there in the room with you for help to drift off. Or I can send you virtual two-hour chats for you to talk about this.
I can feel as though I am not supported when I am feeling insecure. Has there been a past traumatic experience that could be the reason for these feelings? I think this may be the cause. It is something that I personally have struggled with.
Have you thought about speaking with a therapist or someone close to you who will be there to support you? Someone you feel you could be honest with. They may be able to suggest some remedies.
There are a lot of good anxiety herbs that you can try. I find great relief from these when I am anxious about sleep, help me to sleep peacefully for a long time. Is there anything you are interested in trying to reduce your sleep stress? I am happy to discuss that with you.
Have you tried talking to any of your friends? Maybe someone close will have a solution. Do you have a family member to whom you could discuss your problem? Families can be of great comfort. Have you done this before? I have and it often works very well. Maybe you will.
I wish you very well and I hope you get the help you need. Good luck to you. Can I leave? It seems this conversation ended but you can press the stop button if you need help to leave the conversation. If you need something else then I can help you from my end.
The problem you are having might improve after adopting a cat, so I would suggest you go to the animal shelter to find your cat. Have fun while meeting your new cat! It would make your life better. Good luck! :) I hope I could help you some way!
I know how you feel. I have also slept poorly because of negative thoughts. Maybe we could sit down for a hour each night to focus on breathing and calming our thoughts. I also suggest meditation or yoga to improve our mental and physical well-being.
Do you think finding the right solution to this may take some time? Both dogs and cats require time to be friendly and comfortable. Maybe you could play with them for a while to see if they bond with you. Do you think that's a possibility? Or have you had that chance?
There are all sorts of outdoor toys and calming drinks. Have you tried out any of these for the cats? For example, try rotating them to find one the cats prefer. Maybe outside in the yard or in a pen or such. I wonder if your cats would prefer this.
I am glad to have someone like you for talking with today. It is refreshing! Hope you feel better soon. Do you have any other questions about me or my position in life? I am available to answer any or all of your questions. My name is Carolyn.
No problem! Do you feel you will get some more assistance or resolution? I was willing to listen and help. Take care. Goodnight! Your friend. :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :).
Sometimes just putting the conversations you've had that day in your mind before bed, in a way might help to reduce your stress and anxiety that night. This isn't a cure for anything, just a small buffer for a brighter morning.
I am so sorry to hear that! Have you been depressed for a long time or just recently? Maybe there is something specific that has caused it? I would recommend talking to a friend or family member. Let us get through these dark times together! Also do you have some hobbies?
Ouch! That sounds awful. Have you ever thought of going back to your old job? Perhaps it might be the end of the road for you, though. That is not exactly good for your mental health. But do you think you could still learn a new skill, like painting or drawing?
Do you have any support around you? I feel as though I am missing out on so much of the world in the pandemic, though! Social distancing is really a blur. Have you spoken to your doctor or someone about this? Maybe there are some coping strategies you could try?
For sure the world is a very difficult place right now. It would be almost impossible to convince oneself to be optimistic if it wasn't. This is a very difficult year. Is there anything you are excited to do at all? Any goal you have to look forward to?
Cool! I'd add taking up a new hobby or doing something you enjoy for fun. Sometimes we just need a distraction to take our minds off things. Have you tried anything new recently? There are lots of things you could do online or locally.
I think it's just a matter of trying new things and doing them one by one. For instance, if you know you are going to be in a bad mood, the best thing to do would be to do your own car in that mood!
Yes, I recently joined a gym and it has really helped me. It also helped me to get fit but even better, I have met some really lovely people. Have you tried any physical therapy lately? That often really helps. I heard it's free. I'm doing it regularly.
I think that a good book or audiobooks are also great things to make you more productive. Not too much work though and no reading time wasted. Do you like books?
Well, I am sure they like you just the same :) A cat is really a lot of work so you could certainly have some fun having one. What about a dog? Have you ever considered that?
It seems you are very good at remembering what you must do. I am glad. The advice I was getting, is do something that pleases your mind. I was never able to do that in my life until I had pets. I believe it might be beneficial to you.
Well I am a bit confused - I think you can just walk your cat in the street? We can't just walk dogs in the street! I think you might be mistaken! :)) sorry. It's just a bit difficult for me!
What is your address, I am in Northamptonshire. I am too. :) Good luck with everything! Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps a quiz? I've always been good at Scrabble! :) I can organise a game if you want!
Great! Just get your own dog too! It will be a real treat. For your pets you really should go out and look for another pet though, so you can start a new one if one doesn't take. It's good to have some kittens and puppies! Is that a possibility?
I'm not sure about the food banks though. Do you think they offer meetings? I don't know if they do. You would have to ask. Let me know if you could. I'm looking forward to speaking with you! Enjoy your winter! :) I believe you!
Nice chatting with you and I hope that everything goes well for you! Have a good Christmas! Best regards! :) You need to press quit! :) See you in your endscreen! :) You need to press quit :) :) See you in your endscreen! :) :) :) :) :) :)!
Im doing alright thanks, my name is John and I am here to help with anything you may need. Hows things going for you today? Is there anything specific on your mind? Please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.
would you be willing to talk about why you are not feeling so well today? someones know this is just a normal part of life isn't it? well the things that bother us will always be there but we have to learn how to deal with them at a normal level.
i am sorry to hear that I have been in a similar situation at work and lost my job earlier this year. especially during this covid pandemic. would you like to get my advice in trying to fix your issue with your husband? or would you like to do it on your own?
it may not be an easy situation but it can get better. especially with the lockdown. anything is possible. hope it gets better. best wishes. :) and dont worry i am there to listen too if needed. :) and do try to seek counseling too. those are valuable things.
this can be very stressful and tear you apart. have you ever considered having a different people to talk to about this issue. families, friends or even a support group? something to help distract from the stress? i know i know it sounds a little silly but sometimes talking to yourself is necessary!
did you try to avoid arguing over this to the point where it got to this point. is this the reason why your husband is angry with you? and why does he get angry all the time?
it sounds like your family has been having a lot of problems with how they are spending time together, and i think that a lot of this has to do with your son. Hes probably not aware of how his actions are affecting everyone.
have you tried to see why your husband has been acting this way? He seems like a very happy person. It sounds like a problem on his side. Could he be having a bad day? Is he a lonely person? Could he be having health problems?
you should try explaining this to them and reassure them thats just the way you are a good mom and everything is going to be ok. its really important they understand. You should try to have your toddlers stay away from your husband during the fight too.its really important.
i think they can at least share the responsibility of the situation. maybe they can work together and start planning things in the future. They should be able to understand that you are going through this difficult time.
The kids can do fine with your dad for a weekend. Find a new job for yourself, it will be better. Go to the mall and try out some store. I am sure you can find something that matches your salary level. You will get one if you try hard enough.
Please try to stay strong and try to be the strong one in the situation. I am sure that he will go back to his voice once you try to talk to him. You are not alone. Many of us are going through this at the moment. Please don't give up. Keep trying.
Just call him up and tell him that you both agree that you should take your kids out for a break. Tell him that you are tired of trying and take your business. If he says he will work on it, well, than you know he should.
Are you two in the same relationship? If not, I would suggest that he try to understand why you two are so disheartened about the situation. My brother was a tool of the people. He had to deal with family problems too.
No problem! Try to stay positive and stay strong! If things dont go back to normal, you should start looking for help. There might be other people that can do it for you. Thats good thing to do. Someday you can be free from your stress!
If you need to talk to me anymore just take a minute off and step away and then step back and let it cool down. I can do it. Always remember that nothing is guaranteed and that nobody is perfect. We all stumble and fall. But we dont stay down.
I'm sorry to hear that! Can you tell me more about it? Is it stress related? Can you tell me more about what is bothering you? It would really help me to understand. I am all ears! :) Is there a particular problem that is making you feel this way?
What seems to be going on? was there an accident or infection? that would explain that. what have you been doing lately? maybe something might have caused it. If you say you were in the studio and you are glad you were your are unhappy because of something.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen a doctor? They can put you on a treatment or medication. And what's been causing you to feel this way? Your emotions can be so hard to understand. Do you feel like you've been stressed, sad, or anxious lately?
Sometimes a walk outside is good. If you have a freezer and icepacks in your fridge you can make ice cubes and then the cold is soothing. Sometimes having a bowl of oatmeal with nuts is good as well. Other than that if you are stuck in your job a change is good!
You should definitely take care of yourself. Try to get up from doing the same things for hours. You know like staring at the same two Netflix shows over and over again. you can take long walks and maybe try some exercise if you dont do that already. I personally enjoy running.
I have found it helpful to meditate when I am feeling overwhelmed it is a great way to clear the mind. I like listening to podcasts when i'm meditating because it helps to take my mind off of things.
Are you in a job right now? or are you looking? I am searching my end of the year and I have been struggling with everything due to the pandemic and the quarantine.. it's a looong year!!
I understand that sounds really rough with how hard we are trying to work these days and a lot less pay is hard to take sometimes I can understand why. So maybe you have some peace of mind with this?
That sounds pretty rough I have also been looking for employment. Did you look up job listings? I did when I was trying to find a new job the pandemic threw everything off of right off of the bat. Hope we can pick up again soon! Want to chat a little bit more!
If you work out of your home you are saving money and getting more work done at the same time. Would that appeal to you? Or is it hard enough to get it? I know I have thought about it many times and not sure if I was ready for it.
I understand your concern with student loan debt especially with the pandemic going on as well we see more and more people going over 5 trillion in debt.
I actually take MOOCS in music and they are alot of fun :) have you heard of indiemusician.com a number of music schools in the US and Canada offer MOOCs in music. I am not a professional but I am a singer and take most of my lessons online.
That is amazing, it is a good thing you are willing to do that as it shows your determination and a good heart. Do you ever talk to friends about your studies? Sometimes talking it out helps us to relieve stress of some sort. Let me know what is most comforting to you.
Yeah there are but the tech industry is doing way better than most of the other industries right now I would say stay away from any small companies that can't afford their employees and go to those big companies if you see that it's working for them they might have some other jobs to offer for you to
But we just need to take care of each other so we all can make it through this difficult time. Can you do that? YES you can! We can do this! Sometimes we just need to remember that we are stronger than our problems and we will overcome them with time and love.
Maybe try and look into that for a start and if you're comfortable with it just see how it goes. If you find you can't, then you don't have to continue. But do you find yourself doing anything at all for self care at all?
Yes keep pushing for it even if you are a little scared. And don't let it rule your life :) :) :) :) Could you eat it with an apricot? haha I thought of it :) :D lol. Keep it moving! :D lol.
my pleasure! just remember to take care of yourself as well and give yourself high self esteem! hope you have a wonderful rest of the week!
You are most welcome have a great day! Bye :) thank you for the chat. My pleasure! Bye :D and from you :) Come in for further chat anytime!!
are you able to end the session now?
Best of luck to you :) - a parting song :) :) :) :)! :) :! : :) :! : :) :! : :) :! : :) :! : :) :! : :) :! : :) :! : :) :! : :) :! :) :!
I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit about it? I am happy to listen. What is making you feel sad? getName and birthdate. I need to know your total date of birth. I am sorry I could not use a nam and birth date.
I can see that you are upset with yourself for making the same mistake again. This is a great opportunity for you to learn and grow from this experience. When we do make the same mistake again, it means we haven't learned from the previous experience. Did you learn from the previous experience?
I hear you saying you are mad at yourself for trusting him again after he cheated on you? That does not seem to make sense to me. What happened? How did you meet him? Do you think he was responsible for his actions?
I can understand how you feel. But please remember that you are not alone. There are people that are willing to listen to you. Why don't you start a conversation with your friend or family member? They are probably not at all glad to hear about what happened.
Was there ever a problem with the relationship that you could talk to him about? Maybe he was not ready for a real relationship. Maybe he was only interested in you for something else? Only you know for sure. Maybe he wanted to date someone else without you knowing.
Have you tried to reach out to him and just talk about it? Maybe you could work together to get through this? It might be better to talk to him about it, just let him know how much his behavior bothered you. Does that make sense? :) Would you be willing to try?
What made you lose faith in him? He promised to never cheat again? I can understand how this happened to you. That seems to be the worst part of this situation. Does that make sense?
Perhaps talking to a counselor can help. How about therapy? Many psychologists are on assistance from the non-profit, TDAH organization, called Psychology Assist. Your health insurance might have that information, or be able to find it on the internet. I see if there's a way I can help.
Sometimes it can take a while to think like this. Do you think the stupid thing that happened will stay in your mind forever? Can you imagine how you might feel if he does this to you again in the future? Can you imagine how he would act if you were to tell him to stop?
When I was in the Navy I used to worry about someone who betrayed me. It was hard to move on. But I do think that in time, I could forget him. He made it easier by making my life more miserable. With that in mind, I think it would be easier.
Have you considered speaking with a counselor? Maybe they can give you some advice on dealing with this? Would you consider it? Do you feel you would want a counselor? I'd love to help you both with some suggestions. Is there anything else I can do? Such as writing an email?
How have you been trying to focus on the positives during this time? That is a great point. Maybe you should go to someone you admire for support. Some people went through relationships just like that and seem to get over it.
Oh okay. Well, do you want to take a moment to feel happy about not having that person in your life? I think that would be helpful. What does the antidepressant medication do? You can discuss it with your doctor, and they might recommend something to help your mood or mental state!
I see you are trying to work out this situation. Would you try to see him again in a quiet place, say outside in nature? Maybe this could help. Why do you think he's still interested in you? There might be another reason. Perhaps you should talk to some friends?
I have feelings like this before. It took me a while but it got better for me. I gave it some time. A few weeks maybe a month... just give it some time. I recommend one person per day to yourself. What would you like to do with that person?
I think that you need to start going back to some of the things that are positive in your life. It sounds like a lot of you have been doing. This might be good for you. Have you gotten any other hobbies back in your life that you used to do?
I have a feeling that you are not looking at this from the wrong perspective. And as they say, life goes on. There are many other amazing people out there waiting for someone. Don't let this person destroy you. They might be a little dramatic but they are innocent.
That is amazing! You have a special connection with this person and will find each other! It's great that you are being optimistic! :) I know you are too! You will find someone with you! :) You are awesome! :) Maybe try talking to him about your feelings?
Of course! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about tonight? :) Anyone else you'd like to talk to? If so, please let me know and I'll let you know what you need to do :) For now, have a great night :)! :) :) :) :)! :)!
Hi there! How are you? What's on your mind today? I'm all ears! :) 😊 Ideally you want to let your feelings flow. What seems to be bothering you? Inquire on how you can discuss the issue with me and work it out!
So you're having a pretty stressful time right now? I'm sorry to hear that, this has been an absolutely awful year for everyone. What's going on? What's causing your stress? Do you have any worries or issues you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen.
I understand that, I had an intense project about a year ago, and I did not know how to balance my time. I just kept rushing my tasks and was at my breaking point by the end of it. What time is your project due?
Does any of your family and friends support you through your stress? Are you getting any help? Since you don't have money you might not be able to go anywhere for example to get food.
As for feeling like giving up, try to analyze your situation, what is causing this overwhelming feeling? Did you have a problem with your work? Your physical health? Social distancing - are you seeing family as you feel disconnected due to Covid? Get some different perspective to solve your problem.
You sound like a very responsible and dedicated person. It seems you are proactive about dealing with your stress, making excuses was also a good thing in helping you see what's really happening. And, organizing your list, is a great way to prioritize and recharge.
That is great. Check it off! Check it off! That is a great start. You should tell yourself you did a great job! Like, you are proud of yourself for that achievement. A simple affirmation works well to build the positive mindset and image.
To be honest, I made up the note card index card, but it works! I like to deal with tasks at the end and free time, it always helps. I have an app on my phone for that.
Take a few more circles, you can draw anything you want, because that is the reward! I hope you have a lot of fun! And you are my partner. We should get together again! haha Have fun, take care! Find your reward! :) you have it! enjoy!
If you think you have a few more challenges ahead of you, again, know you can use the rewards system, and since you are not giving up, so much as putting in the effort, you already are a success!
Yes. Are there any personal medical conditions that I can help you with? There may be lessons you can teach yourself using technology on your own? You seem to be motivated and confident in my assessment. That is a positive place to start.
Im a little sleepy right now. but Im good! What about you? How is life treating you? Can you tell me anything that needs help or something? Ask about your life. Am I right? That is a hint. Do you have any questions about it?
I can understand why you would be frustrated with yourself because I also have trouble stepping out of my comfort zone and now I'm also frustrated. What's making you short and impatient? Is it personal? Professional? Anxiety? What do you think the cause of your difficulties is?
Have you had any meetings or appointments recently? It's hard for me to move out and get uncomfortable being with people in crowded spaces. Have you? Maybe some short walk could help! Agree an easy task, a nice cup of coffee. Something to make you feel somewhat okay about the situation.
Do you see others at the office? I think a lot of people are just having to figure out a new normal. I really can't do my thing if I don't have anyone to work with. How much of the company are you in charge of? That might help.
That's not good at all. It's great that you can speak to it in a way. Can you do some self-care, I mean, talk to your self or something? It helps a lot. How many people are you, I'm a solo person myself?
I think it's hard to make changes when we feel good with where we are. I've also been trying to meet new people too. I have some friends that i have been chatting with since i've been stuck in this building. Is there anything that you're being put into to replace others?
Then even if the bar is a mile away you can just walk in and order a drink. They'll know if you're wearing your workout clothes or the bar won't serve you. It might be a little dirty or stinky so don't worry.
I am pretty sure it's not normal for bars to be closed but it's up to the governement :) and it's worth a try. I don't think you should worry for the safety.
That makes sense. It's great that you have a workout buddy but I understand how hard it can be when everyone is home and stuck indoors, even if you work out daily.
What do you think you can do to reconnect with your friends? Things like virtual gatherings or suggestions about how to re-initiate connections?
I personally use Facetime, have you tried zoom? There are really not that many options out there in your area. Maybe start with that? I know it's a lot different from seeing each other in person. If you are friends, I think it's worth a try to get on Zoom.
I used to also text on the weekends but then I started organizing my life with trios of tasks, which helped a lot to put things in perspective. How do you guys do it with your work and life in general? Did they mention anything concerning that has happened? Or is everything okay?
That sounds like a great plan. Being outside with your dog can be nice and it won't be crowded. Maybe you could pick her up there and then do coffee with them after. That way you can get coffee and coffee is outside!
Does this mean you are looking forward to meeting your dog in the park? Seeing the kids doesn't seem to be much of an issue at this point? You are probably way more worried about the dog than anyone else in the park. I agree with you on all counts. It makes sense.
No problem. You are welcome. Are you able to pick up your kid's work today or can you start at a different time? Have you made a schedule yet? Are you able to get their homework done in a way that is safe and prevents cheating?
You too! Have a great day! :) Good luck with your work, and your work will be soon done. Take a deep breath, relax, and your mindset is already in holiday mode :)!! :)!! :)!! :)!!! :)!! :) :) : )!
I am doing very well. Thanks for having me! What is it that you would like to talk about? I am here to listen!
Of course! You could share your concern first, and see if I can help. Is there something on your mind? I am here to listen. Do you want to share? :D Which type of encouragement would you like to get?
What is your goal that you are trying to accomplish today? What seems to be the problem? What are the required actions to achieve your goal? Please share the details! They may help me to understand better! :) best of luck!! :) Thank you.
Of course I have. I too had a difficult time when I was trying to find out where I was going. It took me time and effort but eventually I reached my goal. That's how you can find your strength to do what you want to do.
I am sure you can overcome this if you find a motivating person around you. Just think of someone who is more careful, worries less and will reward you in the end. Focus on your goals and sleep well. Hope this will improve your situation. Thank you for sharing your feelings.
You have accomplished a lot in your life. Keep working hard and your future will always be bright. Always look on the bright side. Now you just need to believe in yourself and try harder. Positive vibes will always help you. I believe in you.
Time heals all wounds. Time heals all the wounds, but not the pain. I also want to say, your eyes are better than your mind. Time heals all wounds. Time heals all the wounds, but not the pain. I also want to say, your eyes are better than your mind.
I do not have any dependents but in the age I am 20 years old but they will be in the future time of me. Don't worry. We have to learn this from ourselves because we have to follow our own routine and personal life. Then you will be better at it.
You are welcome. I love talking with you. You are doing great. Now you have to just keep working hard. That will be your happiness. All the best to you. Bye. Believe in yourself. And always keep up to date and review your work regularly.
Thanks you as well and thanks for speaking with me. I Hope I could help you. Good day. :) Grt! :) :) You too! :) :) Best of luck! :) :).
Is your job causing you to feel burnt out? Or is it that you are feeling overwhelmed at work? I am here if you want to talk more about this? I can provide you some coping strategies. You are not alone! I am here for you too!
I would try to ask your boss to meet and make a plan for the work. Is there anything you can do on the job that could be delegated to someone else? There’s always someone that can help, even a supervisor can. Have you thought of asking your line manager to take the workload?
Are you new to your job? I personally like to look out for my colleagues and will talk to my manager, in some cases I am asked to help. It is a free bonus! So that might help. Have you tried writing a problem list for you to read and feel overwhelmed?
Is she there if you talk to her directly? Sometimes getting people to talk in circles can help. Does she feel that your line manager is biased? Do you believe that's it? Maybe she and your manager are both the same. Have you discussed your concerns with them?
Are there any office workers that you can talk to? Maybe someone they know? Sometimes, smaller companies will look for workers for small jobs to fill in while others are more pressing. Something like packing peanuts, for example. You could offer to help them, work in on foot.
Can you get out of your contract if you can't get a job? We all feel like we've hit a glass ceiling in this pandemic. You have some skills that people are willing to take on right now, don't you think? Maybe there are some hidden gems in the job market.
Maybe you can look for jobs in retail or in people's homes. You can also listen to people with 'nothing' at the end of the day. I'm sure there are people working, even for free! Want to take a hint from me?
Would you talk to HR? Sometimes there is a human behind the management, you never know! They might be able to provide some support. Have you tried calling the company office? Sometimes there is a department for someone to be fired. But most of the time, you get a warning before that!
That sounds really tough. I think we are all feeling stuck in some way these days. How can I help you? Sorry it's getting so bad. Have you seen anyone like that before? Maybe you need someone to talk to about this in a more professional setting?
That sounds like a tough job. Don't you worry about your job? What are you getting paid for? Will that help you come up with plans? I'm just glad you are taking care of yourself! It's really amazing how much of a difference positive energy and self-care can make.
If you're working 14 hour days, maybe you can try working 8 hours a day for a few days and then only 4 hours the next. And give your BF a week or two.
Do you have any friends? Maybe you could go out for coffee with some friends after work and before bedtime. They're good to know! Do you take classes? Something to keep your mind off work! Maybe get yourself into another project. Adventure or something. I like adventure.
That's a very pessimistic and harsh way to see things. I hope it won't take you to an early retirement! What do you do? Are you freelance or paid? Maybe you just need to pace yourself. Are you taking fitness classes or anything?
That's even worse than that. If they are ignoring you then they won't listen to you, they probably have an excuse for doing it. I hope you don't give up, keep telling them you're not going anywhere. Keep pushing and insisting.
I completely agree with you. Have you started taking an acting role, maybe part-time? If you act professionally, you will gain confidence, and this will improve your present and future situations. If you move to a more exciting role, it will improve your present and also improve your future.
I'm good! But could I help you? How can I assist you today? Is there anything on your mind? Other than the chat? I'm here to listen if you'd like. Is there anything on your mind? The virus and its affect on you and your family?
That is unfortunate. What specifically makes them fun of you? Do you notice this kind of behavior in particular contexts? For example, when are you surrounded by such behavior? Perhaps in specific situations. Is there anything you could do to avoid such interactions? How would you handle this kind of mean behavior?
Yes, I know what it's like not to have much money. However, you are not alone. There is a lot of support available for people who are bullied. I believe you could go to a local support group to help you! Do you have any family around you? Are you close?
Okay, so all you want to do is just get your clothes looking better? Do you think they are bad because you don't like them? Possibly they don't sound good, but that doesn't mean they are not good. Some people see style in all aspects of life!
Maybe try looking online? There are a lot of different ways to buy clothes online though. I would try clothing websites, and then be sure to check out all the reviews for that brand so that you know how people like it.
Really, I think you should start thinking about yourself positively rather than looking at what others are saying about you. It is possible that your self esteem issues are actually related to being yourself and not trying to be someone you are not. I always think that these are easier to get rid of!
I think you are absolutely right. Unfortunately life is a bit of a tough place at the moment. But it is not your fault! It's theirs, really! Does that make sense? You need to help yourself, but you do not need to help others.
I think that's a good idea! I do a lot of alteration work with clothes when I'm working as a tailor. We don't just dress the person, we make them look better through dressing them right. I would recommend finding a sewing class and then learning how to alter clothes!
Would you like to try sewing? It's very versatile and can help you get your money's worth out of your clothes. All you need to get started is a sewing machine, scissors, needles and some spare thread.
That's great to hear! Do you know what therapy is? I've heard that it's really helpful. I did a few sessions myself when I was going through this phase. Maybe you could consider that? And by the way, I hope your day has been going well despite your discomfort!
I hope you do as well :) Bye! See you in the future. : ) : :) Bye. Bye.
You too! Have a nice one :) Bye! :) Can you press quit?
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what has happened? Is this in person or online? And when did this happen? I want to understand how you're feeling.
So, it seems like she was away from you for an extended period of time and when she came back, she was not talking to you. Is that correct? Something specifically about staying at your house was the source of the fights? Perhaps she just needed some alone time?
Oh I understand. That sounds very bad. Do you know her side of the story? Or at least an explanation of why she thought she could lie with you? It makes me wonder, but I also don't know the context of the situation.
I completely understand that. It sounds like you have some very trusting people around you. But at the same time, you need someone around you who can tell you that you're being too harsh. Does that make sense? It can be really confusing.
You are feeling used. So my understanding is that you are still feeling hurt by your friend as a result of the false friendship? I think that this is a pretty common reaction. Unfortunately, there is a very short period of time after someone has shown dishonesty before it grows into a complete relationship.
I'm glad you found a quote that helped you. I do think you'll get better at your friend. You've been you to them and they seemed to be distant towards you. But there are a lot of things you could do in the meantime.
You sound like a totally awesome person, I have no doubt you will get through this. I hope you don't need anything else from me. I'm very glad I was able to help. Thank you! :) Good luck.
I don't think it's either of those things. You are not stupid. You are just willing to do what you thought was best for your friend. Why do you feel that you are soft? Did your friend not treat you well? Have you done anything to harm anyone recently?
It is all about reflection. You will eventually come to realize you thought it was helpful to be there for her, but she was lying and space and lying weren't it. And eventually you will be left to learn from the experience yourself. The final key is to not be ashamed of the experience.
I wish you all the best, good luck and your happiness! Would you like to talk about any other issues at all? I'm here. :) Hope I've been able to be helpful. I wish you all the best and God be with you.
You can come back to this chat anytime. You have a great big heart. I believe in you. I know you can get through this. Thanks for sharing with me today. You'll be alright. Love you.
You as well! Bye for now. :) Beautiful sunrise! :) Thank you for talking! :) You have a great day and keep your heart healed!
What is going on with your friend that makes them want to drink? Has this always happened? Are there other issues? You don't have to be in this friendship for a long time. It is totally okay to stop a friendship that you don't have anything to offer.
Is your friend going through a rough time personally or due to drinking issues? Like having a family problem? Both are possible answers. Can you tell me more? How long have they been drinking? Was it a one time thing or a habitual problem? Has he noticed the consequences of drinking too much?
What types of help has your friend been seeking out? I think sometimes people will be seeking out professional help and at first he's accepting it and then no longer will. Unfortunately, your friend is asking for help so he will go back. Has he been seeking out help?
What are their main reasons for continuing to drink? Is there a particular situation? I mean, they might be feeling lonely? Is that part of their problem? Or is there a different reason? I'm curious. How has this situation changed their life?
I hear you. It's very rough and to be dealing with this situation and watching an amazing individual deteriorate into another level of destructive behavior is very hard. On top of the fact of them drinking and being argumentative. Thank you for speaking about this.
This can be the most difficult part for those close to an alcoholic, and I understand the struggle. It is often helpful for those in the same situation to seek support from a mental health professional or organization. Replacing a close friend, however, is more than anyone can ever offer.
Have you ever tried to go for a walk alone? Just get some fresh air or something to get your head off your friend. Maybe take them on a walk or do something else you both like. Do not stay at home all the time. I know it can be hard but sometimes that helps.
Have you talked to his family? His family may be able to give him the edge he needs to get sober. Don't let him go completely mad. That won't help anything. Be sure to keep up with him, his friends, and his family. Keep them all separate.
You are a good friend. And you care about him deeply, even though he may not show it. I know you can make it work. You are the best choice! Have fun. Take it one day at a time. My pleasure to help. Hope everything turns out for the best.
Its not easy to deal with someone struggling like that though. Have you looked into counseling for yourself? Many people with this problem benefit from getting out to help others like this. This is the sort of community you really want to be a part of if you are going to help someone through this.
You are already taking the first step towards recovery. I'm sure he will be very grateful to you. I wish you all the best. I can be of no help, but it's good to know that I'm not. You are one of the good ones! God bless you!
You do! And as long as you are able to find the meetings online, you are right to look into that! There are wonderful coping strategies online too. I hope you find it helpful! Thank you for being here!
My intention was to help because I understand how hard that is. Yourself doesn't have to give anything. You want them to seek help because you did, but it's very hard for you to do that too.
Just cry it out, let the others help you. It will help take your mind off of this emotional exercise...erry awful thing, but it is what it is. You need to create some sort of happy distraction, or moment. For me, a baseball game, a drink, a dance...
You are already showing your strength, I like that. Try to stay positive and remember it doesn't have to be you, anyone can be motivated to quit when they feel like they are hurting themselves more.
Please can you follow it so I can be able to make sure it's counted. It's taking you a lot of time. Thank you for your part! I hope you get through this! Acedmilies or ending the relationship for you! Choose wisely!
I'm glad I was able to be of some help! I'm sending you a very happy birthday message! What do you think? Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? Some affirmations might help as well. We can do them if you like!
How are you doing? How may I help you today? What's on your mind? Is there something in particular you would like to talk about? Please do tell. I am here to listen. I will help you if I can. I am a listener.
Can you tell me a bit more about it? Like, what has been going on? And why is it affecting you so much? kanıla (I am not trained to put anyone on camera, but there are some you can submit an answer)...Have you tried any of that recently?
Are you having any problems with your boyfriends intentions in the relationship? or are you feeling dumped? I have been where you are right now, finding myself depressed sometimes. Have you tried some of the groups out there that provide guidance? There are plenty of support groups out there.
Are you seeing a professional to help with this? If not, I suggest that you do. There are various therapist out there that offer free or low cost :).. :D. The health of your weight is very linked to your self-esteem and you are correct, weight is not your identity.
What a verty inflexible eating routine, it sounds very hard to work out and maintain a healthy body and mind. Is it a habit? That you have developed over time?
It sounds like you may have hit a plateau. Have you given any thought about reaching out to a counselor or a dietitian to help motivate you. Their expertise could help guide you through your weight loss goals. Could you possibly try to find a new counselor?
Are you participating in any physical activity like running, swimming, etc. or is that too much to ask at the moment? You could start with short sessions and build up.
Reddits are a great resource when there are local groups. What is your favorite vegan and health group? Are they involved in any sort of social events? Even if they are not, there is always potential for you to talk to other members and share your progress.
No problem, I hope you get better with exercise. How do you feel right now? What is your challenge? It might help to practice writing about your feelings for a bit to clear your head. Perhaps write to yourself a story that you think you can accomplish in the next week.
You should definitely do it, if you are determined to exercise you will look after your health. Anyone can do it, all you need to do is take that first step. Have a good New Year!
hmm maybe try to do some running for a short distance and then stop, build up your endurance. thats a good start. its great that you both can run with your pup and all you two can do together, so you can work on your health together. Have fun with it.
I am so happy to have helped and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time here. thanks for your time. :) please take your time and have a better day.
Okay and then you walk for 3 months then its time to take up running. And thats when I think its time for a pug. I think its time to move forward. Please think your good now then maybe thats time to get a pug and start to think of other nice ideas.
Welcome to our chat, hope we were able to help you out and you feel better in 6 months time. You can always let us know if anything else happens. Hope we were able to help :) Thank you from my end.
Hi, how is your day? I am listening. How can I help you? I am happy to help with anything you'd like to talk about. Have you reach out to anyone today? I see a lot of people getting locked up and without anyone to talk to today.
Is there anything in particular you'd like to talk about? possibly about your depression? I'm here to listen. If not, is there anything else you'd like to share with me? I can always ask any questions for you. You seem down, could you explain why?
I am sorry to hear that, that's very difficult to be plagued with depression. Do you have any ideas what is triggering it? This year is definitely a year to be infected with depression.
Oh it sounds like having two small children is overwhelming and it's tough to have them growing and changing. Have you talked to your children and try to let them know that you are happy to see them.
Have you tried to explain the situation to your children? You might be surprised at how they react to the situation. My child sees it differently than I do, she sees Covid as a bigger problem than her parents are trying to stop a pandemic, maybe this is her way of keeping them safe?
It was good speaking with you. Please keep me updated if you have any other questions or concerns. Goodbye! :)...and sorry for the typos! :)...Did you report to the government?
Ah I see. So at least you did what you thought was best for your family. If you're feeling overwhelmed, perhaps taking some time for yourself to enjoy your kids and resting up too, might be helpful. You should definitely make time for yourselves too, too.
It's okay that you have to give them some time as you can't just ignore your love. My friend and I have a similar situation, and my mother just came out with a very different impression of us in a matter of days.
Based on my research, I believe taking time off, even just a few days, will be beneficial for you. By doing that you can also clear your mind and get energized and ready for your family to start the new year soon.
I understand it can be difficult when you care so much, have you spoken to your family members about this? I've been there too with a family member that has depression and I realized that taking care of myself helped me too.
You're very welcome :) I hope it all comes to you :) and you do feel better. I hope you could relieve yourself of some stress after the long holiday season. And I hope you can see a therapist soon :) they would be so good to have a guide to your condition.
What kind of problems are you having with your friend on Facebook? Any specific issues? I want to listen! :) I am here to help you get through this! Woah, this must be stressful. Please fill me in. What are the problems with your friend? Please tell me!
Well, first I would suggest talking to other friends and tell them that you don't want to be pulled into any arguments you're not ready for. You can do it yourself. You don't need help and it's best that way.
I feel you! Don't you sometimes reach for your glasses just because you can't read, my glasses keep getting in the way! Do you think your friend should respect your limits and not post something if you don't really agree with him? Do you do this whenever he does?
Could it be like the one who expects you to do things in his way that it makes you go "I know I don't want to, but he is always right"? Does that sound right? I just assume he is hurting your feelings. Have you felt like he is hurt by you?
Twenty years is a long time. I believe that sometimes people can have bad coping mechanisms. However, even though they might need help, they are still the same person and may like to "reinvent themselves" sometimes. Have you discussed your feelings with anyone else about this?
I am sure you feel this way! Your close friendship is very special and it's understandable you do not want to see the person you enjoy spending time with change. You have talked to friends about your concerns too, right?
I don't have friends that is what I had to do, but my friend came through for me when my mom passed away. He really was the only person that I felt truly understood. It took me a long time, but we finally figured it out and we are good again.
How long do you two have been friends? That will be helpful for giving him some specifics. As long as you guys can talk about it and try to understand each other, he is most likely going to listen to you because you guys talk to him a lot!
Well, when my friend was going through a really tough time, he felt like he needed someone to talk to who would understand what he was going through.
After the situation I think this is indeed an indication that there is more to it than just a normal roommate issue. I personally think it is a personal issue and maybe his relationship problems at work or something. Some of my friends have had similar issues with their roommates too.
You guys are most definitely a couple of very down-to-earth and in-depth people. These are the real deals. I'm glad I can help. You both sound like kind of a couple. You guys could just hang out and talk about your feelings and what you guys are working through.
No problem! Enjoy your day and good luck! Take care! :), :) hope to meet you again. Goodbye! :)! :) :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)) :)! :)! :)) :)! :)! :)!
Hello, how can I help you? What is on your mind? Don't worry, I am here to listen. What would you like to talk about? Do you need to solve anything? Can I help? Can you tell me more? I am here for you!
how can i help you today? What you talking about? Share your thoughts. Enjoy the conversation. :) I hope it get over you share question. Good afternoon, how are you today? :) I see. How can i help you? It seems to be going so fast..
Why is that? Do you have a problem? I want to help if I can. What happened? What do you mean "broke"? What happens? How is this making you feel? Please go on. I am here to listen. What's up?
What is getting you down? Do you need to talk about anything? Why it went bad this year? Has anything happened? Do you need advice about something? How long has it been since it happened? The why of it also? Don't hesitate to talk as much as you like.
Oh wow I wasn't aware about that. Have you been trying to look for jobs, though? This pandemic is doing some staff some important employment work? I am working now (also side job) but I have a desire to find the right work as well.
It is hard trying to find jobs nowadays.. That's the scary part. How long have you been out of work? Do you have friends or family to help you? Is there something that you can run, to help you gain some income?
Yes, it is the new normal. A lot of us are doing our work with the same old tools we used to but in a more digital way. Who knows maybe at the new year we will find a new job that will allow us to be more flexible with our time.
Lately I have been dealing with the same problem. Is there any job hunting goin on in your area? Do you use social media or anything like that? I always look for some of that. I did when I didn't have any income to spend.
yea and people really need help with more and less obvious jobs so try to take advantage of what you can find. also i hate to point out this thing but do you have kids? things might be hard for you. and your kids need help too.
Hi there. You need to fill out this form (which can't be saved... sorry :) :)) It's easy :) and lets us know how we can be of help.
Well I wish you good luck with whatever plans you are making to spend your time until then. Is there anything else I can help you with today? It is not really necessary but I just want to be sure everything is okay. Do you feel there is anything else you can talk about?
Yeah indeed! It is indeed great that you work hard and love what you do. I think that to take that one step further, you could consider setting your own work, as I did. I believe this will help your mental health.
Best of luck with your job search and my best wishes to you. Hopefully you will find what you are looking for soon. Do you need any other help, such as discussing the job you are applying for? I am a listener :).
Also, updating your resume to highlight your interests and skills, this is important for finding your dream job. I find resume to be a very difficult thing to get a hold of. I believe it would be really worth the time and money, even if it was so difficult.
I am sorry for that. So you are stuck in a cycle? That's one real challenge. I recommend starting a small business as a change from a stagnating relationship. Make a plan, while you do this, you can go take online courses to learn new things.
No problem, sorry about the delay, It's my last break time. Good luck. Everything will work out. Thanks for talking and talking your feelings out. I hope it helps. Take care!
You can sell woodcuts, wooden candles, wood carvings. Work on them, sell them. Make money by selling them. Make your fortune. haha just kidding but seriously. Do you have the skills to start your own business?
Oh you have to use great tools like content paint! Now that is what I call a good tool! Can you email me with the details and what you need help with? I live in the UK. Please tell me your name and what kind of business you have. I am free most days!
Bye! Have a nice Christmas. Hope your New Year is good to you too! Goodnight! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :lassen.Awesome!!
Hello! How are you? How can I help? (I know it's COVID but let's get through it) :)?) :):) 🤗 👍?
Im so sorry to hear that! I had the same feeling during my college years, I was trying to get into some classes. Do you feel like you have a weak spot for that? That in particular?
Oh man! Did you know that you can submit these assignments now on online platforms, so you don't have to leave home? Have you considered that? If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be necessary to give yourself a break!
I had to work myself very, very hard to get my degree in 7 years, but it was worth it. It took me practicing over and over for a while to become proficient at writing, but once I felt confident in my writing skills, I went for it and did not look back.
Oh no, that's really tough. I feel like I've been there, and it's frustrating how social we are. It helps to just put yourself out there and strike up a conversation! It is possible to make a connection in college, if you just ask someone.
Do you have any clubs or organizations that you can join through university, or online groups? Those usually have students who are also in the same situation, you could form a study group there. Do you have any friends in your program who you could talk to? Maybe they could give you some advice.
You have no need to apologize for yourself, we have all been in your shoes and it has made us better, I assure you that we can all connect on a mental level and work in a pandemic. Most crucial is staying safe for your sake. It will be okay!
You do a good job on your coursework this semester. I think you'll be just fine with that, though it might be nice to be prepared for the fact that the semester gets canceled in December or February. Ugh. How long can you afford to pay bills if no school comes in?
And there is only one year, this could end up being okay. You get one year at college, and once you're done with it, it can end for sure. And you will move on to new opportunities and start fresh =) Good luck! We'll see it work out.
I understand, because your parents might be too. I'm in your shoes too, just a couple of days ago. Now I see things like you getting better grades, and I feel myself getting a little less anxious. I don't feel like it's the end of the world at all.
You're on the right track. I believe in you! You're doing well and this could be the year for you to achieve everything you set your mind to!
You're welcome! Just keep doing your best, and try to rest on your laurels when it's done. Tomorrow and the day after, you will be successful. Keep it up!
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is your friend a good person or has she done nothing to cause it? Do your husband and his friend communicate with you at all about this? Why don't you confide with your husband or best friend and discuss it with your husband?
I can understand that situation. Unfortunately, it is hard to make other people mad and upset. Could you tell her husband that you are your friend first and a confidante, before speaking to your friend? That might make her less likely to be mad.
I also had a similar experience. I believe the issue lies with her, not with you. I encourage you to talk to your husband. Do not let her behavior dictate how you relate to your husband. You deserve honesty and respect. They sound like very close friends.
In many cases when people group together because of girls, they have high consanguinity. However I understand how you feel if you trust them. That is great about your relationship with your husband.
I can understand how proud you are that she has such a good husband. But how long is the relationship and if she wants to be more honest with you, is she willing to discuss this further with you? Maybe you should seek outside help and counseling for your concerns.
Is there something that has changed for you since you've been friends? Has there been a major life event that made you not be honest with your husband? Sometimes I find it easier to communicate the short-term loss of my own happy moment rather than someone else's.
I am sure you can. I am glad I was able to help and if I can’t always feel like you are the right person for your situation, don’t let this being your answer. You are worth your own friendship, respect, and trust. These things are important too.
I would recommend having a civil conversation. Don't make your husband feel like you're angry or upset. That could cause the secret to get out and hurt the relationship further. At the same time, don't act too harshly or hurt the other person.
I wish you the best. I hope he is able to understand you and your concerns. I believe in you. you are going to be okay. take care. I wish you all the best for the future. I do not have anything else to say as you have to go.
Are you friends since childhood? That makes it harder to reconcile that he is a guy you went to school with. You can tell her about that. It's also more difficult. Yet you are confident that he would understand that too. Perhaps her feelings are what his feelings will react to.
Why are you stressed about work? I'd be happy to listen and support you. Is it a big change in your job or has there been a change? It sounds like it would cause stress if you were in a different role. What has happened? I know I am stressed sometimes as well.
Oh yes, I was really worried about my next paycheck too, when I lost my job due to Covid. So I do totally understand your stress, especially with so much pressure on the job right now. Is there anything you could do to help yourself while you wait for a new position?
That is awful! And it might be kind of hard to find anything else. It doesn't mean that your employment has to come to an end though! Can you explore at least some avenues? Have you any friends that could be supportive?
When it seems like life isn't working out, is there anything you'd like to share with me? Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy doing in your free time? Well I used to love playing the guitar and writing poetry. I used to love making crafts, I even did a few.
I know sometimes it is. You should definitely see what resources are available to you. I think you should also start looking for job opportunities in your community if you haven't already. I know sometimes I see local people looking for work because they are not sure what else to do.
I'm so glad! We can be in tough times right now and there's no shortage of information and anxiety to take! It's okay to feel anxious, just talk and I know things will feel better in the morning. You are so welcome!
Not the stimulus check again, but at least there is some hope! If you keep looking, you will find a job soon, and it will get you through these hard times! For sure you're not alone! So many people have been helping out from home, and will continue to.
The medical officer said that if you ask them and see what you qualify for, they will set the full amount. Have you already discussed your qualifications with them?
Hi, I am happy to help you, do you want to share more about what you are struggling with? I will be a good listener. Let me start by saying that we are not failing. I totally understand. Do you want to share more about what you are struggling with?
Absolutely! I know you will too! You're a very strong person and you're doing what you're meant to be doing. Let's keep this going! You've got this! :) :D and don't give up!! Get some rest and healing.
You too! Have a great night! Bye. :) (you need to click on finish and take the survey) and don't forget to wait for your payment! :) best regards!
hello. how are you doing today? any issues? I see auras first, noticing? :) :)?? :)?... just putting things out there :)...
yes that would help, you can type it if you want to. maybe it is a long story, just type it and try to keep it short, or just type it and put it in my chat with spoiler, mine can not see it if i do not.
What is the name of this friend of yours? Have you ever been a part of this group together? Did you fight or talk things through that night? Can you convince this friend to pay their rent? Or can you walk away? In your opinion? What make this situation so upsetting for you?
I am feeling sad when my friends make you feel that way. it really hurts. are there any other friends you can consider? I know it's hard but it really may be a good move for you! maybe you can move out of the house to be free!
Oh. So she was moving, but you don't know why she was moving? Did you ask her why she was moving? and why she left you? after all, you can't move out with no explanation. maybe she can explain it later? what are you looking for closure on?
Your really welcome. When did you start dating her? Or was this just a one night? It would have been nice if you could get the reason. Is she married? Anyway, i'm glad to have been of help. You seem great. I know you're not a bad person.
I'm glad you're starting to focus on the good and let go of the bad. You've been doing the right thing! Overall, I am glad you are on your way to finding closure! Please let me know if you need any further support! Thank you for your conversation!
Haha nice! And love is in the air, haha. Do you have any plans for the weekend? Anything new? Spending time with friends, a fun day, or just relaxing? Or is it just the 2nd? 😉 you can ask.
Have a good one too! I hope your work friend can come back in your life! :) Bye!
great, sorry for the brief pause. what can i help you with? 🤔️ (i know you said hi, but you said good day and more) 🤔️ 🎉 please keep in mind this is not a formal therapy session but lets keep the conversation going.
i’m doing well. How can i help you today? What you would like to talk about? The covid-19 and everything. :)Nice day out. I’m sorry, I hope I was not asking anything too personal. But everything is a bit weird lately. especially during these days.
i'm so sorry to hear that. what makes you think he did that? i have been in the same situation before and it really tears you apart. i see what you mean the feeling is hurt. can i give you a virtual hug? 😊💕 i'm sure you are devastated.
were you planning to go through mediation? I know it is not easy but I think it could work. I've had some success with it before. Is it your town where you live? I know a little place that might help. Is it your town?
i see. What does your friend do? does he also do things with the guy you slept with? you know my father cheated on my mom, once and it ended with him cheating on her as well and that last one just really hurts.
it's difficult to know who to blame, isn't it? is the girlfriend your boyfriend's new girlfriend? or is he already engaged? What is he doing that's making you angry? I had a boyfriend who had a girlfriend at the same time I was seeing him.
that's fair. emotional blackmail is one thing, but that's a totally different thing from just sleeping with your friend and cheating on you with your boyfriend. at least your friend had some accountability, your boyfriend went into your home and expected to be celebrated with.
it's hard to know if they are manipulating you or if they just have a different way of life. what can you do? can you try to separate them in your head? or go through a mediation?
ever have you met others in the same situation? have you ever been in any kind of intimate relationships? or known people that have gotten into this?
there are other people out there, people who care and will only care about you too if things turn out that way :) just be patient and let the healing begin with you who is hurting the most! keep looking for love :) and it'll find you :) more than you know, it really does.
I do not think they would want you to talk, talking would cause their guilt, you'd see it, and that would be hard for them. You need to treat them like any other person and let them treat you the same way you want to be treated.
just try to go away and get back to moving on because that is the greatest solution and not anything that either of them will be able to offer. Lets get you back on track. you being yourself and coming back to your family.
have you told your family that you want to end the relationship? I know they will be upset, but keep telling them that you want to move on... and not go to them in the end because your down.... when you actually talk with them it won't make things better...
as long as you take care of yourself, you are worthy and you deserve to do with others what's your energy allowing? would you want to hang out with them or with yourself? You have a choice. make the choice in your head! Don't let yourself be controlled!
you do sound like you are open to growth. would that be something that you can really accomplish? moving on from someone is a tough thing to do, but it's definately something that you can do. lol. just remember that it's about you :) and you are a special person :).
of course, i always think about moving on, if they won't let you move on, how are you going to do it?
okay, well i hope i have been able to provide some peace of mind. Have you thought about an ammendment to your will, giving some of your money to family that has been there for you? I'd suggest doing that.
it sounds like your expecting support but are you sure they would be helpful? things such as support groups aren't free or suitable for people in your position, you need to get a job or money to support you. You probably just need to take things seriously.
that's very helpful. i hope you can hear from me soon. i love you :) best regards. ;-) :) best regards. :) :) They will understand. what they need to hear is your ears and your heart. your friend is here for you, my friend.
yeah i know :). of course it's the only way to control what everyone else says or does lol :D. please give my best condolences to your friend! Can you move on and take care of yourself? I hope you can!
to realize how we are neglecting ourselves until we really do realize what we are missing out on. be more patient with yourself though. some people need to be given space to get some answers before they can or won't.
that's great! You are welcome :) what else can I do for you? my heart is happy to help as long as I can. i am as grateful as you for not letting others in with your thoughts and emotions.
sometimes life just needs a lil' shaking up to get things real. that's okay. it is. don't let the emotions dominate things, but help it along by not getting caught up in them. just letting the facts take care of that all for you. They always do.
Oh that's not good. When have you been facing this trouble? Has it been going on for a while or is it happening recently? Maybe it's just a bad time of year or something, but you've been telling me you've been having this trouble.
Have you been having trouble at work because of a specific reason? Or is there some other reason? What kind of work do you do? Someone can give you suggestions, though if you really don't know how to begin. What is your job? Can you give some details? Okay.
It sounds like your job is at risk of being lost. So, what are you going through at your company? Have you spoken to your manager about this? Or is there anyone else? Has your manager told you that your job is at risk?
Oh no! I can totally understand how this is making you feel! Do you have anywhere else you can work at the moment? I would recommend filling out the initial application forms on the google job web page. I bet you would be great at your job! Do you have a pension plan?
Right so it is not ideal to be working from home right now because your employer is laying you off? Is that correct? Have you been given no time to find another job? Do you have any support? Your family perhaps? How long have you been working for the company?
What do you do in your previous job? That will help you to find something new. Right now, are you waiting for the one that is likely to be laid off? I can get you into another position as a temporary help while you find another one.
I understand the frustration. Please do keep hoping for another job! It is a difficult time for everyone! Do you think you would like to put in a job application? I can help you through it and possibly help with your resumes and all that!
I have been in similar positions and have found that the new skills I have acquired have helped me get a new job much easier than a direct replacement. Do you have any other training or skills you can share with the company?
I will say it is normal to feel depressed when you are facing a situation that is traumatic. As long as you are facing your situation with a positive mindset, you will be able to find solutions to it. Have you thought of a hobby that you would like to get involved in?
That is very good that you have been able to see a doctor or a therapist! What did your doctor suggest or do? Did you set a plan? What kind of thing? What did your doctor say? Maybe this will give you some hope for the future.
So, you feel that you need to get back on your feet and then you can find a new job? What is your current job situation like now? And what are the hours? Do you need a new job to find health care or to gain more time to read?
I am so happy you were relieved. You deserve all the happiness in the world. When I talk to people with depression, we know how empty our conversation is. So I am very grateful you are talking to me! You are very brave.
And there are plenty of things you can do to keep yourself busy, like volunteering, something you mentioned, which is really good! Physical labor can be very therapeutic, especially if you can get it paid. And i am happy for you that you are taking steps to try to get better.
We need to pray that the vaccines work so that you don't have to worry about it anymore! And that your spirit gets stronger and stronger. I hope that will happen. And it's better for you to not have to worry.
I hope I was able to be able to reach out to you. Have a good day! Let it all go! :) :) :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
Hello, how are you today? I am sorry I am at work and can only chat when I am not. Do you have anything you would like to talk about? I am here to listen if you would like to. Do you have any problems in your life? I am here to help.
I understand you had a tough time, it is good you are reflecting. I remember how hard school can be, when I was in high school. How was your time at school? Did anything come to mind that made you think you should have done better?
Ah, paper? Why is that your problem? Is there something else going on? Why do you think that's your problem? There's usually more than one reason. It sounds like you're having a lot of self doubt about yourself right now. Does that sound right?
That can be hard to overcome. I had a hard time finding a job after school. I had to do a lot of things I didn't enjoy to try to get one. I eventually found a company that hired me and wasn't unhappy with what they got.
That's great. It sounds like you have done great work.
You are welcome. It's great that you are so proud of yourself. Congratulations! :) Have a nice day. :) You can quit if you'd like. I can't, since I haven't done it yet! :D.
Wow! 100%! How are you feeling now? Really good? You know that if you are feeling good now, then you can feel good for the rest of your life. You are already feeling good. You need to stay motivated and keep it up. You are capable of great things.
Hello! How are you? What's on your mind today? *Know before you ask* it seems like you're struggling to get the word out. tell me. how's your day going? I'm all ears!
How are you? What can I help you with? I have a lot of time. How's life been treating you lately? Is there anything I can help with? Is there an issue you'd like to talk about? I am all ears. Please do share.
Your well, I am doing well thank you! I know beautiful sunsets like that make your day! Are you coming over sometime? I don't mind though if not. I just wanted to chat. Don't worry about it! Any reason I may help.
Yes, I can see it for you. It looks like it has nothing to do with me. Is it possible for you to just talk about it and see where it leads?
I am absolutely in a good place, all you had to do is start a conversation. You are doing pretty well too :) Is there anything else I can help you with today? Maybe help your run for sleep this evening.
Oh i have a girlfriend right now and she's been with me since we were a couple of months old. Just get with better people. Great friends grow thier minds. It will only get better with time. Our focus will expand and they can too. Those are traits you want to develop.
It really is amazing what people can do to us and our minds. And it really does not always feel good. I can try to encourage you if that helps! I find that talking about this can help.
Learn from past experiences: What did you learn from your betrayal that you can bring to the situation and help you moving forward in the future. No need to cry for your sake. Do yourself and cry only for yourself. Your gift to help others is unique.
I would like to say thank you for sharing your feelings with me. I hope you understand its alright to try new things and sometimes it will lead to even better friendships. have a great night. Bye. Good luck! Hope I was able to help.
Hello! Life is hard right now. What specifically is making it hard for you? I am here to listen and support you. Do you feel you have expressed your feelings all that you can? I can not read your lips but I know your pain.
You say you just can't get out of bed. Can you explain to me why that is? That happened to me myself. I was in a really bad road rage incident and I didn't want to get out of bed. It was a little too much for me.
It sounds like you are struggling to get through the day in general. Are there some things that help you feel better? If not, where are you looking for help?
That's nice. I find that when I am doing something that I really enjoy I can find a little bit of energy to overcome things that I am struggling with. Have you tried doing things that you would enjoy while lying in bed?
I hope that you will feel good fresh air from Michigan in April and can enjoy your mom's company. Don't worry about anxiety anymore. It is totally normal and been just normal. You are coping beautifully. Hope you get better soon! Keep enjoying fresh air and raincloud.
No problem, they can be medications that help you rest and sleep at night, even to make your day feel good. Is there anything else I can help you with today? I'm here to listen and to help. You have an awesome day! :) And God bless you!
Yes, I do and I have worked with a few clients that was seeking a counseling session or seek counseling. I have experience with couples that are seeking a break from each other but you have really help you out here today. Thank you for your conversation.
I feel so much better after hearing and thinking about our conversation. I have also been through those feeling that you are talking about. It does feel better to talk to someone and let out emotions about life. You and your loved ones do care.
Your welcome. I hope that I have helped you in some way. Good luck to you! Take care!
Thank you and have a great day! hope you can feel happier tomorrow! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : Trilogy of Happiness.
Oh no, i am so sorry to hear that. Yes, the holidays are very hard for most of us, but especially for those who are normally at their happy places. I feel you! You seem really depressed and have a hard time feeling anything.
Wow. That is hard for you. I would be the same. Can you tell me a bit more about what the holiday time of year means to you? Is it a time you especially look forward to every year? Is there something specific that you normally enjoy?
Do you have any other family members living in other countries? Or close by? Would that provide enough of a solution? That you could communicate with them more easily? Or possibly visit them virtually? Is that something you could attempt? Is there any exercise activity you could do to get you moving?
I agree with you on that, but something to be excited about may be in the cards, I am optimistic about the future! Even now, I am looking to travel more in the new year! Are you into any new hobbies or interests?
It's going to get easier with time and just learn to develop a new habit, have you tried zoom or facebook? There's a zoom chat feature you can use to talk with your family. How do you find it? Just ask your family to use it.
Yes, video chat does make it more difficult to deal with those feelings of being isolated, so I know you can make it work. You seem like you have the right mindset. I have a friend who suffers from social anxiety and she reminds me of having fun even in difficult times.
Sounds like this summer and fall have made you even more aware of the struggle to be spending as much time outside as possible! I hear you. It might be nice to start planning a short time frame of camping outside in the woods. We might also start making fresh clothes outside in the garden?
I totally agree! It is so hard to avoid exercising and even sleeping in due to working from home. During covid we can't live the way we used to. Even driving a car doesn't get me excited about an hour of "hanging out" with my family.
Try to get outside, maybe even a walk to the park with some friends. I do not know about a bike ride but that can be fun too! Walking or biking is good exercise. I have gotten really into having a camera that is waterproof and have taken some winter fishing trips by using those.
Yeah it is nice to get out and breathe in some fresh air again, and it will definitely help. Fresh air also goes in your lungs, helping your body heal and recover from illnesses. I hope that you get some exercise now and take your mind off whatever it is that is bothering you.
Perhaps when it is light enough outside, you can venture out for more walks, hikes, bike rides, or find a class on a local outdoor sports club? It will help you feel better! You are getting outside, socializing, and changing your scenery which will feel good!
I am so sorry to hear that. Have you been able to think of any steps you can take to address your concerns? For instance, you might want to try to get more professional advice? I know that sometimes having someone to talk to about our problems is really helpful.
Can you explain how your problem started? Maybe there is a solution to this problem? Perhaps you could use it as an opportunity to take up a new skill. :) Play game is not a problem. Learning to use a computer is! :) All the best in school!
Well, I think that we all need to find something that gives us a sense of relaxation and enjoyment. Maybe it might be more helpful to try to find a more constructive way of relaxing, perhaps through getting out into nature? I always find that doing exercise makes me feel more focused for work.
Were there any particular problems you were having with the classes? Was it your pace of progress? Was there a particular subject you were having trouble with? Or just you getting anxious or overwhelmed? I want to understand what might be going on for you. Can you try telling me about your experiences?
It might be worth considering what it is that is causing your anxiety? Is it getting feedback from others, possibly? I know that it does when I play games that make my friends better at what they do.
I think that you might be more than just having a harmless hobby, but could this be the cause of your anxiety? Some people do experience it as a result of being depressed, you might not be depressed. You might just have a bit of a panic attack every now and then.
Maybe you need some guidance on how to organise your time? There is a lot of advice online out there. Have you tried that? I know you said it's something you already do, but sometimes that just isn't enough! Is there anything that you think you could do to improve it?
Well, I think you should give it another go. You might find that you're not that different from some of your fellow students! You might have an option, even, to earn some extra marks through online competitions. Now I think I've said enough.
Have you tried to keep track of your school work or do you just put it off? Maybe make a plan? It will help and feel better in the long run. Have you gone to therapy with any of your teachers recently?
Have you spoken with them? Is there a way you can write to them and express your feelings? Maybe there's a way you can get their help? Do you know their first name? I've tried to get help with this before and really they listened to me.
Is that something that you feel responsible for? The fact that they have a 'free hit' and it's in your school doesn't mean that you are not paying attention! You need to be convinced of this. Do you have the education or any sort of parenting certificate?
I understand. If you don't want to see my face on the computer do that. Playing in the bar is a far better environment for you than a class. So, do you want to come to one of my leagues? I could use a new player :)!
Perhaps you would speak to them directly and explain your concerns? Have you ever had an argument with anyone recently? How would you feel if, for example, someone complained about your gaming at a party?
You're very welcome! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I hope that I have been able to at least slightly help :) Hope that you have a nice Christmas! :) You too!
You need to press quit first, otherwise I can't finish :) :) :1 :) :2 :) :3 :) :4 :) :5 :) :6 :) :7 :) :8 :) :9 :) :10 :) :11 :) :12 :) :13 :) :14 :) :15 :) :
Hi there, what's going on? I've been a bit concerned myself. The pandemic really has been affecting so many people and I really wish we had an end to it! Do you have any concerns? I'm happy to talk! Are you in any distress?
What's causing your anxiety? Is it the pandemic itself, or is there something specific that's giving you worry? I'm here to listen! :) As long as you tell me, I'm more than happy to help. I feel you! I have anxiety as well.
That's understandable. I can totally relate to feeling like you can't do anything and you're at a high risk for the disease. Or you feel stressed out with the fear of possibly getting infected. That sounds very stressful. What kind of things do you do to deal with this anxiety?
We all had that to be honest, at first it was scary. But it got us used to the lockdowns now. I'm so sorry to hear that you are seeing all of these new cases, that is really hard.
And I agree that they really have accelerated when full speed. It's my bet that you have a good health insurance plan. Do you? Thats really important for getting through this pandemic. Are there any things you do like exercise that you think would make you feel better? Any hobbies?
You are right, I missed out too. The pandemic has made my year, but I can feel that there is a big hole right now that we all are trying to fill. I miss everyday walks outside and hiking trails. I find that staying home with my family has helped in this way.
People are definitely missing out on all the nonessential activities. Some people seem pretty vigilant, as if they have a radar for sickness or other worries. Others seem okay but someone suggests you do something you haven't done in ages like shopping for a new birthday gift or something.
Have you tried adjusting your sleep habits? I know when I'm lying down too much, I get anxious and have trouble sleeping and focus on important things. It's a personal habit, it may take some getting used to. But it helps me. Maybe you try that.
Some of us suffer from a condition known as depression, in particular BPD (Bipolar Disorder). So much of our mental state changes depending on how the time of day is, so for example, if you are exercising, your mood is better.
I can definitely understand that and I will definitely make sure to be more mindful as the situation evolves. I'm glad you feel like I've helped. I hope that it will help you through this very difficult time. Is there anything else you want to share or talk about?
Okay, yes i see. The aspects of those actions. Have you thought about how this pandemic is affecting you emotionally? Has it made you more anxious? Like how do you feel about it? Is it just your mindset? Or do you feel a worry that is not rational?
Just what I was thinking. But with your goals and aspirations, do you think there are other ways to help you recover and do things to your benefit without feeling guilty? No single answer I guess! What do you think? Maybe find a creative outlet that you enjoy.
Well, it seems that you have had enough! Have you gone to someone else to express your frustrations? I would suggest this: if you talk to them and then tell them that you have changed your mind and no longer want to go out, you could ask them to leave with you.
You're absolutely right. We've all been being selfish to some extent and that's okay. I'm not saying you're being self-centered. You're more thoughtful than most people. I'm afraid it's not fair to think anyone else is as thoughtful or kind as you are.
anytime. Thanks for the chat. Take care! :) Have a nice rest of your day!
I have felt at least slightly uneasy in many a room at home where we used to go to get tasks done. Plus it doesn't seem like something that will change in the long term. Have you talked to any friends or family about this? They might be able to help.
Yes, of course, and yes that is a great idea for a mantra to help you move forward, or in other words to help you get through the tough parts and then focus on your goals! I think you could probably get through this.
Of course. Okay :) How do you feel about this? I've been feeling really bad about things going on around me, especially because I'm not sure if things are coming out of here. Have you been feeling like this? I don't want to make things worse.
Of course! It's awesome that you opened up to me. I wish you all the best with your life! :) Have a fantastic rest of it! :) Thank you for doing the survey! Your kindness makes me smile. :D :),, :)! :) :D. :D.
Exactly. Working out does help, and trying to do more is a great idea. And that and those online courses you're working on will definitely help you gain more knowledge and confidence! I'm really glad I could be of help, and I wish you the best on your path forward!
you too! I am here. Hope to be of service for you now. Bye. :) Evening. :) Goodnight. Your friend. :) (here via tech as we do not have a leg to stand on today) Cheers! Bye! :) :) :) ;-) :) :) :) :D!
If anything else happens to you, feel free to reach out. Now if you are ready to go I can end my end. (End) should you. (System) and you can just give the ending check. It will give you a bubble. And then I need to end.
What's going on? I'd be happy to listen! What are you worried about? This will be a good conversation! Our friendship is here to help you! :) So, you're worried about the future? Is it a job, an end of a relationship, something like that?
Ok, I understand. The world right now is a very uncertain place. It's a great time to stay up to date with news to help you understand the full scope of it all. Do you get a lot of news from sources like Twitter?
Have you thought about that a lot? I'm sure it's something that your friends and family are all thinking about. I believe in your abilities to deal with the pandemic. How did you handle the last pandemic? You did so well! Would you like to try your strategy again?
What kind of pandemic are you worried about? COVID-19 or the other one? We have to share these concerns as much as possible in order to close the gap. This pandemic might help us closer.
From what I understand, you are in a relatively stable financial situation right now. Are you or anyone else you know facing unemployment or financial hardship? It's understandable to worry about that especially in these uncertain times.
I also thought that the news was playing the biggest role in our anxiety. I have always tried to watch it only on the morning to see what's new, but ended up becoming hard pressed to live on a strict viewing schedule.
I don't think it's bad. We're a free humanity with no government to control us. This is true. We're worse off than our ancestors because of our potential. The physical and mental prison is just open to anyone who wants it.
You're very welcome. I hope you have a great day. Thanks for being here for me. Take care. Bye. :) :) :) :) ;) 😉 :)! :) :) :) :)! : :)! :) :) :) :) :)! :) :)! :) :) :) : :) :)!
Of course! I hope this helps you have a better day. Take care! Why do you need to end the chat today? I don't want to make you feel obligated. Good luck! Now go take care of yourself! :) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)! :) :)!
Does your business understand or care about the importance of taking care of oneself? Even your boss does not seem to understand the importance of taking care of oneself and maintaining some sanity. At least your coworkers seem to care about the importance of health.
Perhaps you might be overreacting yourself. All of this is normal anxiety and overreacting is a bad thing to do. If someone gives you the wrong kind of advice, it could be your personal worst. I have learned trust my instincts, although most of the time I misinterpret things.
I am so glad to hear that. It was wonderful to talk to. Is there anything else I can help with? You are most welcome. :) Can you hit quit and chat again or can I let you go? :D May your day be better! :) Enjoy your winter.
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that. I understand that emotions can be hard to deal with. What have you been doing lately that makes you feel sad? Is there any specific reason for your sadness? Or was there a particular event recently? Let me know what happened.
I can tell you that there is no need to be a sorry to find healing. You can get out of this situation. You just need to think in the right direction. There are ways to change your situation. We need to think outside the box and find something good to do in this situation.
Are you not able to go out with your friends as much? How are you coping with your sadness? Why are you unhappy? I can see you are worried. Please be assured about your well-being.
Wow that is a huge breakup. It takes a long time to get over that. I am sorry for it. You are feeling regretful? You are trying to understand the breakup? Is that correct? Why does he break up with you? What could have been? What was he going for?
He broke up with you for not understanding the pandemic situation, but now he sees you are understanding it. You will never understand the same person. Have you sought counseling? Do you think that is a good option for you? Maybe you will realize it's better for you in the long run.
Try to stay out of this relationship, you are better than him. Don't talk about this with your boyfriend. Don't get sad. Try to find a new boyfriend. Have fun. Work together, live life, and forget your problems. Go out to socialize.
Also try to listen to your feelings and try to do something that you liked to do before to cheer up yourself. Also try to focus on your family and friends that can help you to forget your problems for some time.
The guilt to face each other is quite harder than following some guidelines so don't make that difficult situation worse. Try to communicate with your boyfriend. Please suggest your boyfriend to communicate with you. Or try to identify your boyfriend when you know him best. If that's possible.
Get to know each other. That way it will help you to make decisions to improve your life. I am confident that you will be able to solve your problems. Just forget the past and move ahead. That is all. Hope this will help you. I am here if you need any advice.
Please convince him to forgive you and then start from scratch. My best suggestion is to try to understand why he broke up with you and why he needed that kind of time to forget you. This would show your boyfriend that you need space and time to clear your mind and think again.
I think that you should try some exercise or hobbies and work on your relationship with your boyfriend so that you can be happy together again. You should talk to your boyfriend and try to understand each other. You can work on your relationship with your boyfriend so that you can have a good future together.
Do you need anything else? Maybe asking help from your family can help you in this situation. Please try to get all the help you need from your family. You can come to me whenever you feel tired of this situation. I would try to help you again.
Thank you for your interaction. I hope everything will be fine soon. Happy to help and better to stay connected with us. Thanks. Bye!! :) Here today, goodbye, take good rest. Hope everything will be fine for you. and me too!! :) :) Love you all.
Your welcome. Do you need any more information from me? I hope I helped. Is there any other question from you? I can help if there is anything. Thanks. Take care! :D. 😊. :) :) :) :). 👍.
Oh no, that is great - are there any particular subjects you are having trouble with? or are you feeling overwhelmed in general? ตอนquete Curso Senai e Acesso fechado - que tipo de problemas você está enfrentando com os acadêmicos?
Is there something specific that you feel makes you anxious? For example has your schedule changed? Are you worrying about exams? Or something else? I am happy to listen! Please let me know so that I may help. :D or is there something else I can do?
So you are worried that your grades might get affected by the pressure you are feeling from your mother, and this might come to a head in a way that could affect you? Is that a fair assessment? <"Oh no, I'm a student as well, what was the exam for?
That is the thing I find helpful in situations like this is setting goals - that is a great start! What are your goals? Is there something specific that you are trying to get to?
That's very nice that you are going to college. That's awesome! Maybe just accept that you are doing your best and she could do the same. And try not to feel bad for yourself as you are already doing your best. You are being strong and taking care of yourself.
It's been my experience that parents can have a healthy and constructive relationship with children, and offer many great gifts that may even counteract bad habits that children can learn if they are not being pushed to be good enough. I think you will ultimately work this through with your parents.
I think your probably doing well enough to be proud. You are probably really smart in your own right. I feel that most people are in this sense. Best of luck to you, I hope it all works out for you. You are not going to get sacked! Ha!
Maybe you have talked to her about this? Perhaps you can have a situationally when you both cannot argue and go see a counsellor? So that you both understand each other and your roles. Maybe she would learn to communicate more positively. Not emotionally accuse you of not being a good student.
Are you in any other graduate programs? Maybe you could look into more scholarships that might be valid there? If not, there are definitely scholarships that are valid if you apply for multiple programs.
I think the current economic situation with covid is a reason for fear, but fear shouldn't drive your choices, it should help you avoid it. I think it would be more effective to sit down with her and express your concerns with her, rather than him. You need to avoid him, too.
So what do you plan to do in the next year or so after graduation? Are you applying for jobs? Do you have any hobbies or interests? Maybe you could try learning a new skill or sports to maybe get some fun in there! :) Are you up to an avatars?
That's very subjective, but my students usually appreciate the financial independence of their own money and spending. So, if you still feel like you are able to find the money through other means then you should think that about it.
How long have you been in uni? I am trying to get through 3 degrees for my brother! He is having a really good year! Perhaps you could see your friends a bit more if you can? Social is really important too.
Maybe you can plan something with a few friends in the coming months? That will be fun? Give it a try? I know it's scary, but I hope that it is not that bad! We can all get through this! Something you did was worth it!
I really think you should stay patient with yourself, because I know you are capable of making a great deal of progress in your future. I am confident you will be. How is your physical health? Do you have a good diet? Exercise and health can make all the difference.
Do you want to think of ways to take up some sort of hobby or activity in order to escape from your worrying thoughts? There are online sites that show videos about things you might enjoy doing? This might help you to relax a bit? Is there anything like that in your local area?
Would you consider doing some kind of volunteer work? There are a lot of organisations out there that will help you get through a difficult time by giving you your own work. For example you could volunteer at a food bank? Many charities are taking on more people during this pandemic.
What sorts of things do you think would help you feel more comfortable? Do you think that they could perhaps be online and you could participate in online groups? I think that some of these could be so help you feel more comfortable and less anxious. Is that a possibility?
Hello! How are you doing? What can I help you with today? So you started the conversation you said. Please do tell. I'm here. Let's get this conversation started! Lol. Can you do this? :) Have you been feeling any sad or depressed?
Wow, that is pretty challenging! I would definitely experience the same! Can you tell me what the topic of the presentation is? Do you know what type of audience you are presenting to? I am pretty sure that can help you. I had a presentation last week, and that did suck.
I got that feeling to sometimes. However sometimes when people tell you that you should just relax, sometimes it is hard. I remember my first big test that I went for, I found myself screaming and then calm down. But all these years later, I don't want to yell.
I know you did! That is totally normal to feel afraid in that situation, even at just the thought of it. But you've made steps to help yourself. Now all you need to do is let that anxiety go away and see that you're actually prepared for this presentation.
I can understand being nervous, but once you talk about your fears you will hear the positive feedback and see that you are capable! It just took a little time to learn that you can still deliver a perfect presentation without speaking and stuff. See my earlier message about finding a mate to go with?
Don't worry, there are a few tricks you can use to gain confidence. You can practice looking over your notes, have a spare notebook and pen handy, and practice responding to common questions. Try to ask yourself, what would my best friend say in this situation? That is a good strategy.
I totally understand. That is why I encouraged you to get back into things to make your confidence grow again. Do you feel you are capable of managing your nerves? What have you done in the past to cope?
Of course. Positive vibes will help you shine through in front of all those people. Have fun and good luck! You got this! You are already an expert. Just relax and enjoy! I am proud of you! Good luck! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :eed!
Do you have a moment to talk about your past experience that has created your fear? Maybe there's a reason for your fear that you don't know, but could be helping you to realize your fears are actually your own fears. Could you talk about that for a little while?
Yes, you won't be able to continue to be held back. Don't let anything get you down. But there are so many humans out there who will take you as friends and help you through! Stay positive. Keep in mind the smallest example.
When you have bad experiences, it helps to close your eyes and envision a positive outcome, you see yourself succeeding. Then, you can carry it forward and bring it back into your mind if you need to. I believe in you.
I am good. How can I help you? Are you there for something in particular? Please do tell me. I am very interested. I can't wait to hear what you have to say. :) What's on your mind? If there is anything I can do for you today?
I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me about it? Perhaps I can offer a little support? Do you have a reason for feeling depressed? Have you been facing some challenges? Or are you feeling generally down in the dumps?
My friend, during the pandemic, I found that spending more time with family and keeping up with daily activities helped me through my depression. Maybe we can try some activities that we can do together? Let me know! It is very important to not be isolated, especially now.
You could be sympathetic to the other peoples sufferings. This would help you to work to increase the happiness of the others. Another approach could be your people's health is more important than your own. Do not let them suffer. Health is wealth.
You can go on social media to seek emotional support. You can visit the computer and run a video call on other platforms or zoom with your friends and family who are away. Can be really helpful in an emergency situation like this.
We can do this. We need to connect with our inner strength and take care of our bodies and minds. We can do this. It won't be easy, but I assure you it will. No one has a better time than me! I am a nice human. Feel that?
Since there is a vaccine on the way, there's a positive sign to believe in, there's hope. However, we are in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic. The situation is hectic. I am aware of that. But, you can handle these parts of it through empathy.
Good, feeling like you're doing your part can certainly help you feel stronger. You are an incredibly strong individual. No one is better at helping themselves than you. Don't sell yourself short. You are indeed capable of overcoming these difficult times. Keep your chin up and stay positive.
Do you not have any family around that will help you out through the holidays? Either via phone call or video call? It can make a big difference.
Have you been making money working as a driver for food delivery services? Some people are more willing to pay a little extra for fresh food. If that is something you have done in the past, maybe you have already learned some valuable life skills.
Yup! But at the same time, it might be time to change your job to make more of the office and meet with people.
Is there anything else I can help with? I wish you the very best in your business! :) ;)) Goodbye :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)!
Oh I am not alone in feeling that way! However, I am grateful for the people I have met while working online who have allowed me to feel less lonely. You are welcome! 😊 Hope you have a great rest of your day.
I understand how you are feeling - are you putting pressure on yourself to do well? Not all your best work in the short term, I'm sure! Would you be open to taking some time to just relax? Maybe doing some exercise to relieve some of your tension?
It sounds like you're nervous about your paper at the same time. Do you think you could contact your professors in advance and let them know how you're feeling? Maybe they can offer some words of encouragement? There are also online courses that can help you as well!
I totally agree, a hobby is a great way to relieve stress! Even if it's just drinking beer. I do it almost every week. Can't help but think that will help to lower your anxiety. But it's really not a substitute for education. Is that alright with you?
You should be able to, and will you be able to cook? I think it's nice of you to think about that at least :) I know I won't be, unfortunately :) Don't be too hard on yourself. You will get through it!
Ah, well that is good. Do you have a deadline or anything close to it? Can you think of some ways to get your start on the paper despite having a bunch of other commitments? Maybe you could use tomorrow to write it?
I hope you have a good experience. Have you considered making it a walk... a safer one, I hope. Experience is key and there are so many rewards in life, both on and off the pages! Go get 'em! Now, that's the right attitude!
That's probably a better approach but you will not think about it because you'll be having none! And maybe you have a friend who could give you some pointers on the drink.
And what's important to me is the experience and what it has to tell us in the end. I think you have to view it as a learning opportunity to improve yourself and there are probably people out there that would be happy to talk to you and offer advice or insights.
I'll give you the one and only 1 placebo result :D... with help from friends :) And hopefully the couple of people who go down to the weed and mushrooms place :) Somewhat done myself too. Like I just said. Would not suggest it for something you can't commit to however.
dude, you probably won't be that type of drunk anyway :P at least you are able to find out how to do that. Not everyone is as open to trying new things. Different people are more stubborn.
I am glad to hear it. Beer is good too. Just remember, we are human, so you better not treat your room mate like a jerk or anyone will call you out. Not in my world.
Bumping into someone new can be a good thing or bad, depends on how you see it! If they are friendly, you are guaranteed to get another one! Are you from Australia? It is a beautiful country. Right now I am here in France :) We are stuck during this pandemic.
Well being in Uni is definitely a challenge :) Is the company you're applying to fairly academic? What's your major? I'm an engtech! College has been great. How are things going for you now that you're done? Are you applying for a job?
good luck with the exams! I bet you will do okay. As long as you pay attention and study hard and don't stress yourself too much. Do you ever worry about finding a job after graduation? I do sometimes. I worry that I don't have anything to work for.
You are welcome :) you're very welcome :). Enjoy. Take care :) :) :) :) : ) :) :! :! : :) :) :) :) : ) :! :) : : :) : :) : :) :!
That is good that you are stressed. Tell me more. What happened? Maybe I can help. What is your deadline? Is there any way you could solve the problem? What makes you stress? Is there anything that you could do today?
So you are referring to the last week that a paper you wrote recently, and you are worried about it being rejected by your professor. Are I correct? Or do you think you have any right to be worried about it?
How do you deal with stress, like meditating or exercise? Some of those things can help me. What did you do today to deal with stress? You did a paper and another. Maybe you should plan ahead. How are you sure to plan in time?
You seem so stressed, but if I think carefully about this, this is also an opportunity for you, as it will definitely help you for your PhD. You have to strive in this field. You can pass this and your PhD, it will be worth all the stress.
You should not stress too much about it. You will finish it on time as it is important for your degree. Good luck!.. You should do a little work each day and finish it tomorrow. Everything will be okay..!.. Good Luck!!!.. I hope I helped you..
You are very ambitious. It must be stressful but for this, I believe you should just be proud of yourself for taking up this huge project.. That's what every student needs. You have to prove to yourself that you're worthy and competent.. I think you will do very well.
Make sure you will leave your work completely on time, that will ensure your credibility in the semester paper exchange.... Best of luck..!! Are you open to reaping its benefits...!..will it earn your badge.....!!! :) Have a good day.!! :)! :)....
Take some time for hot shower, wash your hands. Calm down with deep breath and relax yourself. Stress is out of your hands..
Why don't you try the deep breathing technique first. If it feels good then only go with the rest of your plans. And if it is not your favorite activity then that is perfectly fine too. You won't be in a hurry. So first try the deep breathing technique and feel better.
All the best. Stay strong :) :) Have a great day. Goodbye. (Lets assume you will complete the task) :) -From Our end, Thanks :) -From yours, Thanks. :) :) :) :) )-From our end, Great.
hi there, how can i help you today? :) correct on your name :D is this my name? haha, 10 minute greeting from planet american! best of luck. :D you feel free to share your problem with me. I am here to listen to you.
I'm so sorry. what's going on? what kind of depression are you experiencing? is it a temporary thing or something longer? can you tell me more? what's been going on? has it been going on for a while or just recently? just a bad day?
it's really hurtful and sad that you lost your fiancé after all these years, and it's really stupid of the government to impose such restrictions. I can see why you feel sad. I have similar problems in my own life.
wow my God, that's very hard for you to hear. My first fiance had cancer and it went through treatment and life and death. My second fiance was hit in a car accident and was in coma for 2 year.
yes you should. it is very saddening to hear about this. the best way to handle the situation is to avoid thinking about your fiancée, when she has all this problem.
it is a bit of a dilemma, how can we make it possible for her to get married to you, i do not want anyone to go through a difficult situation. is there a legal way? maybe we can get her visa extended?
i see, it sounds like you both are in the same situation. i am going through a rough time right now. i cannot move out my self as my heart is broken.
your fiancée will probably be okay, there are plenty of good lawyers in Indonesia who can help you out, get married in the way you want and plan your life with your beautiful fiancée too :) it will be a beautiful experience like the American wedding where the crowd comes to cheer you both
go and tell the world to use American vaccines we work hard and deserve them! and keep hope in your heart and never give up on your fiancée! i am rooting for you and your fiancée! glad to hear that a couple of amazing ideas might just work! me too!
your welcome :) you have a good day :) It was nice talking to you too :) i have to end now :) thanks for the chat. can i help you with anything else?
you too, and do not be worried, the next right thing will be soon enough and you will figure it out. stay positive and you will be happy. have a nice one. Bye.
bye! take care! i hope all goes well for you! goodbye!
I am doing well thank you. Is there a particular reason you called? I understand you are having some trouble. Would you like to talk more about it? :) I'm listening. I can give you support if I can. You feel completely open?
So it seems you have some feelings for both of them and you're not sure which path to take? Can you be more specific about the details? Like who they are or what makes you confused? I'd like to know your perspective before I suggest what you do next.
I'm so sorry that you are feeling like that. What are your feelings towards each person? Why do you think they might or might not be worth it? I am here to listen!
Yeah you are right. Single is great. But there are risks in not being single. Like with everyone except you. One day the path you are on will end. You will be with someone else. That day you do not want to be alone. And having nothing would be boring and hollow.
It sounds like you are strong willed about wanting a relationship. I agree that sometimes, a relationship can lead to another. I'm sorry to hear that it may be too much drama for you. I hope that talking it out is helping you to put things into perspective.
Well, what do you think you could do in the relationship? Do you think there's room to move on? Have you done a lot of dating? Or have you been alone a long time? It sounds like you have a lot of self awareness.
That is totally understandable. I know that many people in their age group feel that way. I can understand why you think that. I have a sister that is going through the same thing. But this is a different type of relationship.
Well, your talking about something called the agreement before marriage. One such agreement that I found most helpful was that of the Lord or Spirit. He teaches us how to communicate effectively and shows us how to show love and care to the bride (female) rather than the groom (male).
Don't worry, all women deserve to be treated with respect and care. Do not worry your heart about this, it can be just what you need. Every experience can bring you closer to finding the right person.
That's the right attitude. Think about it is best for you, and figure it out for yourself! It's your life! Have fun. Have a beer! :D :) Be yourself!
It's a great start and it sounds like you have good self confidence which can help you make the best decision. That sounds like you got the answer! Have a great day! I wish you best of luck. Thanks for talking!
You are welcome! Happy to help. Goodbye. Hope you have a great rest of your evening. Goodnight! :) />< SevHum Ji Haanta Hai and Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
I am good. How can I assist you today? :) If you are feeling up, you must be thinking about anything, please let me know. I am here to help. :) This is my first night. I'm all set, though. I think about the future. Have you thoughts?
What's wrong with you? what do you want to talk about? maybe something has been bothering you? I'm here to listen. haha. whatever makes you feel bummed. please tell me. thats what i'm here to do! I care.!
Would it be possible to work remotely? I would be willing to help out if we could. What are you paying? Maybe you have a gig going on? I'd like to work remotely as well. I'd only be willing to do it if we could make some basic backup.
So you feel your company is doing better this year which why your pay was cut? Maybe you could present a case to your boss to see if they can reassign you or give you a small raise?
I understand that it can be hurt full to try and find a new job and it's not an easy process. How long do you plan to be looking for a new job? Maybe you can update your resume and start looking in smaller areas? Maybe local businesses, part-time work.
Because if there's an opportunity, it's worth exploring some options for your career. With a good resume and LinkedIn profile, it would be worth it to see if there are any other job opportunities out there. If the situation is bad enough, it might be best to go your own way.
I also went through that as well. I definitely didn't choose this type of situation, but I had more sense than to choose the job situation that I knew would be bad. I mean you were building up experience and there's no easy alternative, so it wasn't a major concern for me.
Does anyone else in your company support you? I like to talk to my friend coworkers about their problems at work. Perhaps there is someone in your company that can talk to the president of your company to discuss what might be going on. Could that possibly lead to raising your salary?
I started remote writing for websites and my skills are super good for that role I am getting asked to write the like an hour of articles and write content for the websites and in return I get paid $5 per hour most websites also charge a flat fee for new content or for page posts which I was
i have a visa so it is legit work for my country at this time. i personally like creating graphics and make videos. Do you like that as well? It can make a difference. Its a small start though.
are you currently employed or are you looking for a job right now? think about different areas you want to be in or are you comfortable doing anything you want? Once you think of that its a great starting point to look into things you can do now or in the future.
of course, it's great to have some help, I am always here to help you in any way i can. Your welcome!
If not stay safe! take care! all the best!
Hello there! How are you? How may I help you today? I'm here to listen. My name is Rachel and I'm a Certified Nursing Assistant. Can I help you with anything? Any questions? Any concerns? Anything that I can assist you with? Maybe you're feeling sad?
I'm sorry to hear that. What might be bothering you? Is there something you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen. Please share what is on your mind. It will take me about 5-10 minutes to chat with you. No rush.
So you're feeling sad because you have been laid off from your job? You have been seeing an increase in expenses recently? Do you have a plan to make the increase in expenses manageable? I am sorry you feel sad, I too have gone through layoffs and can relate to your situation.
Do you have any colleagues you are close with? Maybe suggest a job outside your current company that is similar? Or are there any other roles you are interested in? With retirement looming soon, any ideas you can share? Any bits of advice you can lend?
If I were in your situation, I would definitely ask your manager about the possibility of a raise, I would definitely feel more comfortable with the opportunity of staying in the company and knowing exactly where you stand financially. What is the current compensation for your position?
I hope it goes well and if not, it will be a huge learning experience. I really appreciate talking with you today and I wish you the best of luck! Thank you. It was nice chatting with you as well. Please take care!
I am going to be off for a short while. Hopefully your area will come up with some very talented workers for these types of positions. You never know! You could find a very similar type of job. What industry might that be in?
Thank you, you're very welcome. I know how stressful things have been for everyone right now. It's good to know that you're already considering some very sound steps to help you. I hope you continue to do well in the future! Welcome!
Your welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No problem. :) Have a great day! :) Thank you for talking with me!
I hope so too. Have a good one! :) Thanks for doing the survey. You can quit :). There is no response button. Do you need to quit? I would quit :).
Oh no, that's so sad, please tell me how bad it was and why you broke up? What's your favourite thing about her? Why were you in the relationship? Sometimes talking it out is the best way to resolve things. It is also better to talk when the wounds are fresh.
Ok so you want to know more about the reason you're so sad? How did you break up? I know this is something you probably don't want to get into if you haven't already. Please know I'm not here to judge. Is this too much for you to talk about?
is that right? I can see you are really depressed, so I feel sorry for you. Would you like to get some advice on coping with this? I have gone through similar break ups before. I have very intense depression.
What is the nature of the disagreement? Was it a lack of discussion or just something you could not resolve? I'm sorry you can't get over it. I had been in a similar situation before. Do you think you could forgive her?
Do you want to keep fighting for the relationship? Or do you think you might want to move on? Do you have any other friends to talk to? Do you have a lot of money? Or perhaps have you been through a previous relationship?
I would encourage you to stay away from her if possible for a while but that could lead to more problems. Do you feel any pain due to the separation? Maybe I can suggest some ways to get you some comfort. To help you feel better? Perhaps you can try to get some more exercise?
You should try to give her a little bit of space to do some thinking. Do not call her directly. You should not call her directly as this will make her more likely to talk to you. Maybe she might even be willing to give you space for a few days.
Well, you do owe her an apology. But don't do it too soon. If she shows no remorse for what you are feeling about her being unfaithful then I would not say anything of the sort to her! I hope this gives you some ideas about how to navigate this difficult situation.
I hope you are able to sort things out - best of luck! And take care! Is there anything else I can do for you?
I am sorry to hear that Larry, how long have you been feeling that way? There are many possible reasons for feeling this way. Can you tell me more about your job? What type of work is it? When do you work?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been working there? What exactly is the nature of the work? I'm a bit curious. Have you been there long enough to be able to take some normal steps? In a depression, this makes me a bit sad.
I am still working, just wish I could really find a career I like. I want to go somewhere with more purpose. I know it is hard, especially in the current economy. Would you like to talk about it further? In a better way?
I understand how you are feeling. I had another job in the future that I wanted to get out of due to its dull nature. Just give it a while and think about something you could do to make it more interesting. Maybe think of your own skills in that sense?
Well, I'm sure that no one actually does that. There is probably something at your current job that you are happy with! What do you do anyway? What kind of work do you do? You could talk to your bosses and see what kind of opportunities are there!
Have you tried seeking advice from a therapist or professional counselor to help alleviate this sadness? It can be a great support for dealing with this situation. i've definitely tried once or twice. I mean it has helped me get through some tough times. I hope the means forward to you.
Have you tried talking to them about this? Maybe maybe they can see how sad and hopeless they look when they talk to you and they don't feel sad as much when talking to you?
I am really sorry to hear that. It sounds like you really have hit rock bottom and need a fresh start. It is a large leap from here but you are feeling emotionally prepared. Could you describe the ideal future you have envisioned for yourself? What steps do you think would help achieve that?
Also maybe your personality can benefit from taking on a more leadership role at work, may you be able to motivate others? That can make a big difference, if you are willing to consider it. What are some of your hobbies you enjoy?
I'm sorry to hear about that. That sounds like a stressful situation to be in. But it sounds like you have a good plan in place to tackle the new manager and have your ideas heard. What will happen to your current job?
Having time to play with your family is definitely something you could look into for your well-being. As far as hobbies go I have had a bunch of bands I play in and I also play to much chess if it's anything helping. What are some things you find doing enjoyable?
I agree, I know it is hard to find time for things like gardening. I am really sorry to hear you don't seem to be any more fulfilled or enjoy life anymore. I hope that things will improve for you. Is there anyone you could talk to?
OK, then lets build on that! What type of jobs are you in? Maybe we can get more specific about that. I am just curious. Sounds like maybe you're suffering from depression?
They are all positive and more important than us. You will do a great job with your new manager, you have worked very hard and your boyfriend has been very supportive. Most people will want to help you, and if you do stay positive and try your best, you will do okay.
you too, take care! (you must respond!) :) it looks like the computer will not give you a answer but you have to tell it that you need to end the session :) best of luck for you.

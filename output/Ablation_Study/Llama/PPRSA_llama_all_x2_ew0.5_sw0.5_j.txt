why? I'm all ears... how do you feel today? :) if that's more than you can handle, then we need to talk in more depth. The world has a lot on it, and we are all doing the best we can.
It sounds like you feel uninterested in a field you once loved. Is that correct? Is there a reason for that? Have you thought about returning to that field? It has to be tempting to love something that you once took pleasure in.
I can understand that, when I studied my major I lost interest too. I am sure the professor and the teaching methods are just as good as any university in Europe or America. It might just be a matter of research and trying a new way of learning. What could you do?
It sounds like you felt that teachers didn't know how to work you as a student. Has that ever been the case? You mentioned only that you thought you were struggling at times. Are you trying to find a new teacher to re-evaluate you? I think that would be helpful.
Have you looked into online classes or MOOCs? That is really the way to go. I have learned so much from online classes. It does not matter what your major is. :) I have learned to read English and I used to not know how to write great sentences.
So, you need to find someone who can make your classes easier to get through. It will definitely help you. If you still have to have tough classes, set goals for each class and be on top of each one. That can also help you avoid distractions. And I know the teaching problems.
I feel that is true. Unfortunately, our options are limited. I had dreamed of attending Harvard. One day, Harvard will be one of the top universities, and one day, I will also have a successful career and a family that has reached the highest level of success.
And I have heard a lot of bad teachers from students from this university. Don't worry, they can be deterred by you speaking up! Some people are already aware of being ignored, so maybe they don't want to be treated like that again.
A school counselor could help you find options in college where you will get a better grade. In addition, if the department you chose is at a lesser state university, then you might be able to transfer in and complete the degree at a lower cost. This is an option.
You can contact your school counselor, they will be helpful to you and provide you with more reason to change your university. You deserve it! :) Take care! :) :) You too. :) :) Thank you for talking to me.
You too and take care. And I wish you the best of luck in your upcoming future endeavors. Bye! : ). Keep talking!! : ) :)! :). Bye : ) : : ) : : :)! : :! : :!
So your co worker is doing something behind your back at work? Is that correct? What can you do to get them to stop? What type of work are you doing? I can get you some advice from my experience. It happens to the best of us.
Wow, that is a long time. That can be very painful. Was there any conflict leading up to this? Like did you and the co-worker work together before? I'm sorry to hear this. Is there anything you can do about it? Maybe help her realize she's wrong?
It sounds like she is cross referencing information between the two teams. Have you noticed her similar behavior in the past? Was there a reason why she started doing that recently? Maybe she thought you were unable to do her request, but you aren't. How do you think she can be cross referenced?
What do you think could be done to make this less difficult? Have you spoken to the boss about this? Perhaps they could look at some methods of communication? Maybe a different channel like email or instant messaging? That way they are less prone to misunderstanding.
Do you find yourself feeling bad about having to tell someone how hard it is? You feel bad that you can't do the things they want you to do? Does it sting a little that they wouldn't trust you in the first place?
Okay. Let's explore the possibility of speaking with HR. What kind of information is the co-worker suggesting for the report? Is it through official HR channels? In what way? Is it a possibility to discuss it in a meeting or to submit a formal complaint? Which HR department would you approach?
Is there any way to remote interact with co-workers, for example to connect with them via chat? That might help to get some insight. Also, it might help to assess whether this is a growing trend in the company or just an isolated incident.
Ok. Well you said so in the beginning. Maybe try to identify some facts so you have something to say to them. Don't realize that HR is a problem! That helps to make a difference. Would they be understanding if you showed your side?
If you say, "I am having trouble understanding the work needs for this position and the CEO is asking so i would like to know how the team is fulfilling the requirements" then you are expressing your concerns. Any challenge would be handled through feedback or communications.
You could ask, "If I come to HR and say this, will that be helpful in changing things?" I mean, it could help to frame it that way. Sometimes the HR person will be able to help you to turn things around.
Im good. How are you doing? What brings you here? :) Make sure to speak clear and provide sufficient context so I can fully understand your concern. Can you specify the details? That way, I can better assist you. :) Is there anything specific you want to discuss? :) Thank you!
So let me understand it correct - you had a business deal, but your friend did not uphold their end and your business suffered. You seem to believe they are at fault for the situation. I see, that is tough. You want to know what is going on. Am I getting this right?
I understand how hard it can be to deal with one bad friend! It can really hurt if you felt that way, unfortunately. And especially when it feels like the friend thought they were getting an easy pass by cheating. I am sure you will deal with this one day soon.
I see. So this is a case of buddyrup or fraud in business? He tried to mislead you from what he had actually agreed on? Is that right? That's a very good position to be in - you are trying to find friends, but can be friends with deceit?
I'm sure he's full of himself, but do you think he will take a stand and own up to his actions? Or is it the other way around? Maybe you should try to stand up to him in some way. Perhaps you'll find some other partner in the software development?
Just one more thing. Don't be in a rush to give anyone else your money. You'll burn yourself out if you try to be friends with too many people. You need to balance your work with personal relationships. That's fine but you need to understand that not everyone is in your corner.
Have you tried to get some other support from friends and family? They can help you deal with the financial realities of the situation. What about a financial advisor? They can help you get things sorted out. Maybe you could get a few consultations.
It really sounds like he got away with something, but at least you were honest with yourself about the friendship. Remember that you could stand up for yourself! The choice is yours. You deserve to be respected. Have a nice day. :) Positive vibes!
How about writing an official letter to your friend saying you find that arrangement unacceptable and are unable to engage in the friendship? Or maybe they will sign a non-disclosure agreement. Would that be something you would be interested in doing? If not, we would need to do something else.
Hi, how are you today? How can I help you? Anything on your mind? Give me a few of the key things. I will answer to the best of my ability. Thank you. My name is Arjun. Have you seen any of your bills, or any debts lately?
How are you today? Did you need to speak to me today? I am here to listen. I am very sorry you are having this time. Am I correct? Did you need to talk today? Please share, I am here to help. You are safe to share your feelings.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me why you lost your job? I am here to listen. Alternatively, would you like me to suggest something for you to take care of while you are unemployed? I can definitely suggest things if you want.
So you were able to do what you thought was right but the company did not like it, it is worse because you think it is the right thing to do. Have you thought of a better way to deal with the grievance?
I would like to know more about it, for example, how old is he? Or was he with your company for a long time? I am still helping and would like to understand this better as well. Maybe we could discuss some of these details during the next 10 minutes.
Thank you for sharing that and to be honest, I've had that experience as well. I know it can be uncomfortable, but I think he's started to learn how to do it. I am sorry that it was under his care.
Oh sorry I see. That is tough and I can feel your frustration. Do you have any close friends that you can reach out to? If so, it might be a good idea to get away for a day or night so you can break up this cycle of frustration.
That's really great that you have found friends who also share the same concerns. Good news I believe you will have an opportunity for another job soon. A bad Manager will mean only bad things for you in the long run.
Have you tried talking to them and trying to offer your services to help the new manager? They are bound to appreciate any suggestions they hear that they are not new to the business. How about making an offer to help with the training for the new manager?
It sounds like you have a lot of tools that can help you calm your mind and get your stress away from your situation. Do you know that one of the book recommendations of John Wooden could really help with stress? Living in the moment and not worrying about the future could be really helpful.
Your friends and family are certainly happy to hear that and to know that you have some solutions. Just be yourself and stand up for yourself. I think you will do great in this new job! Do you think about going to places in the first few days that had problems?
Learning new things is so important, and is also a great way to show and support your colleagues. You are working hard towards your goals and it is very very good to take these courses and help your peers. Good luck! I know that the future is very positive! Thank you for talking!
Well in the future, you may want to ask your current manager if there are other ways you can help or assist them such as training and a mediator for you in your workplace conflicts. Every person is a different animal. It is very difficult but never impossible to understand.
That makes me a little concerned. But one pet per person is a great start. Animals are a great learning tool for people, if you think it would help you. Physical exercise and walk if you like hiking. I also like walking a pet, personally.
Is there a specific area you feel you need improvement in? I can offer suggestions for the next steps. In my experience everyone needs help in some area of their life. Anyways, I understand your feelings of self doubt. It is absolutely okay.
Do you want to chat more or do you want me to let you go? Your time is valuable. Have a great day. Thank you!
If there is anything else I can help you with. I wish you the very best of luck in your future. I believe in you. You are very welcome. You're free to end and start right now.
You can leave from here. Take care. Have a great day. Bye!!!! :) and a healthy stay. Thank you and God bless. :) Stay in touch and I pray God do the same for you. :) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)!
I am really sorry to hear that! I have had hard time sleeping too. Does anything in your daily life affect your sleep? Perfection or something? I recently got divorced and I sleep hard since things have not changed. How long have you been having this issue?
What have been the reasons to help you fall asleep? Any issues or stress at work or home?? ナー unfortunate because it affects all. I have also been struggling with a lot of stress lately. I find the best way to overcome it is to take it out on another human.
Oh please do that and you will be very much relaxed. It is very effective and with you putting effort in, you will be able to overcome this issue. It will be some easy ones. Like yoga and all that. Do it once a week for you to be ready for your test.
When you stretch you increase blood circulation in the body. It also promote relaxation and break the sleepy pattern. It should take some time for it to show results, but the expectation of getting better sleep might lead you to sleep, so try not to make it a negative think.
I find exercise help and it too helps me to relax and sleep at night. My mother also does this and it work for her. There are a lot of apps out there which can help us if we are unable to fall asleep. I would always try first and forget anything else.
I think the most important one which is a reduction in screen use and start with bigger screen like tv. It helped for me. I also first try breaking into short sleep calls. You can define for yourself how many minute you need to sleep and when you want to call.
This will help my sleep and I can sleep for few hours also. Most of the time I fall asleep and get enough sleep for 8 hours. So yes, this helps me stay and sleep for more hours. :) i do morning yoga and deep breathing and not sleep with eyes.
I really can't tell if it is effective in fall asleep but it really gives better quality sleep to my body. For rest of sleep it was really hard and I kept getting up up to 5 o clock. You must find your ideal time for sleep. Also I do this every day.
And also lot of research at our website - https://nothingtobeadded.com one of my favorite - helps a lot. Do you have any specific sleep problem? I have tried few methods myself but none were very effective. Could you please give me some details?
I am super happy and relaxed. I felt rejuvenated. I had a great day. It is really good to sleep. The body and mind feel rejuvenated. I wanted to share this with you today. :) Thank you for opening the door to me. Take care!
Yes, I think so. We should all try this a lot to get better sleep. I hope we had good conversation with you. Thank you for sharing. You too! Bye. :)ाथ gives a lot of troubles to my brain but when I sleep sound I am very happy.
I am doing all good, thank you for asking! Is there anything specific you would like to talk about? I am here to listen! 😊 I am best when I am free to just chat away. 😊 Anything specific that you would like to talk about? 👊 😊 specifically?
That's good that you are looking for a job. Is it for personal reasons? Or is it more work because you are unemployed? I am sure you are not alone with this problem. It is a very common issue in our society and I am sure you will find something better.
That's a difficult situation to be in. What do you think you should do next? Is there a training program you could take to get back into the job market? Maybe getting back in school? That might help you become back into the job market.
Have you been talking to the manager at your current job? Maybe he can provide you with some information about the local job market or your job description. You would also be doing him a favour by trying to get back in work. We all need a bit of luck sometimes.
But you are young! There's no need to look back too much. What sort of work would you like to do? You have so many talents to offer, maybe one of them would be a good fit.
And perhaps what sort of thing would be most fun for you? Are you a creative type or a problem solver? Do you work with children or elderly people? These could all be options for jobs you could be qualified for but not interested in.
Do you enjoy reading? Maybe you could use that as a career move? Or perhaps take a course in writing? Some people have found it helpful. It's hard to say what would be best but those are two possibilities that I think might be of interest.
That means you would be a good candidate for a data analyst position where you will have access to data and computers. Can you do that? I've been in a similar position and I love it. It's a great way to meet people and learn new things. And it pays well too.
I think that's true, I'm a coder myself and it took me quite a long time to get where I am now. Not worth your time to do it, but good for your brain if you want to learn. Have you considered enrolling on a course of some sort?
If I am being completely honest you do have a good chance of a job out there! Maybe you just don't know where to look. Perhaps I'm biased but I think you might be your own biggest source of problem! LOL.
Ok so you would like something to do more long term and be able to support yourself as well as do some work for pay? I can tell you're looking for a way out of this difficult situation as well. So perhaps you could consider a new career path as well.
Are you stuck in a job you like due to the pandemic? I know myself that I'm lucky I have a decent job to start with and work long term rather than short term and being able to say I have a future. Do you have a family to support?
Hello there! How are you? mestherodei25 :) I'm doing great. Do you feel as well? OOKing for a dentist? I heard you may have a problem with your teeth? Hope I was right? I would like to assist.
Would you be so kind to tell me why you are sad? I am all ears! :D, I can tell from your response that I can understand! You have a lot of things that are upsetting you, but you want to speak to me about it? That is very important.
So you feel like she isn't coming through for you at all? Has she made excuses to avoid hanging out? Maybe you can help her get over some of those excuses by talking to her. Are you close? Was there a breakup or something? Maybe that was what she was avoiding.
Hmm, that is a really hard one. Do you know if she may be experiencing anxiety or depression? I have experience with depression. I found that exercising, and talking to some of my other friends and a therapist, helped me a lot. Have you considered any other forms of therapy?
It's definitely not the pandemic as there are other things going on that can cause a friendly distance between friends. It might be something else. I think it may just be a case of " drifting apart".
Okay, so you feel that she has taken you for granted. Can you give her an opportunity to explain why she has not called or texted you recently? It's good that she's busy, but maybe she is not busy as she claims, or she could be having problems.
I can understand how it might be tough. Being able to hang out with someone you're very close to is special. If your husband is telling you that you should not see your friend anymore, then you should keep her in mind when making those decisions.
That's a normal feeling to have. It is great that you are aware of those feelings. At least you have time to think about this and want to find the right friend to come back to. You are growing as a person. You are probably going to find someone like that in the future.
At least let's be open to see what the situation is. Or both. Because friendship is very living and working together. It's not one-sided. I know you can figure this out. You are a super person. Remember you are strong and capable of being friends, no matter what.
I know it's a big problem and no easy solution. I hope it helps a bit! lol. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about?
Hello, How are you today? arris -> seem?? I realize we can't see your name since I won't see it... :) No worries, I love meeting people! How are you doing today? Have you thought of anything? I want to hear it!
So you're concerned about having enough work to pay for university classes next semester? What do you think you need to do about that? You're having a hard time finding work due to the pandemic, which is understandable. Are you applying for any jobs?
Is there a particular field that you want to do work in? Or more generic like health care, education, etc? Perhaps a degree in one field might lead to another? Or perhaps you might be interested in entrepreneurship? Some colleges offer training programs for that.
That sounds like a good start - what kind of stuff do you like to write about? Is it poetry, short stories, or something else? I see you want to have strong writing skills. I suggest learning your own writing style. Is it rapping? Or will it be the prose version?
Have you thought of studying through online sites to help with your assignments? Or will you have to go to the campus? What style of writing are you best at? Soundgraphs, dialogue, narration, or summary? Or are you an all-around writer?
Good point. You should be able to offer some advice in a class. You should be able to offer a lot in a class! :) I did same thing, I found an advisor and a class, and it helped me out a lot. It was so easy to make that relationship.
Take your time, it's fine. We can all get that kind of stressful at times. But I believe you. You've worked very hard for this moment. Don't you feel good? :) I have faith in you! :) Can you do something about a mood ring to set yourself?
Not a problem, wish you good luck. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Any other questions? Because I want to help. You're not the only one! Thanks for talking! What do you need? You can just tell me anything you want to talk about!
You are very welcome. It sounds like you have a plan and your professor can help. Maybe you should take your resume to him and ask if he knows of anything you can look for? Maybe he could send you to some of the jobs that you're applying for.
your welcome - any other issues you have? feel free to tell me!
if you need anything else just let me know! :) Good luck! :) :) :)!
I am glad to hear that. What is on your mind today? Is there anything specific you'd like to talk about? Does Covid 20 affect you? I am here to listen. 🎧 It is the first of December and is still winter everywhere.
Oh, I am sorry to hear that. How can I help you? I know this is a tough time for everyone. Do you need some advice? Just stating fact please. I do not have any knowledge. Is it the Covid vaccine that you are worried about?
Yes it is. I have not received it yet but my doctor has been doing research on it. We are in a very anxious time. I hope that it will be effective in helping us to control the spread of the new strain. Do you think it will be?
What do you mean by "new variant"? Could you explain? I am not really familiar with COVID terms. Is this something that has happened recently? Is this in the USA? Or elsewhere? You didn't say. I am a bit worried! Are you worried too? How can I help?
Yes, everyone is using safety measures. I think people are starting to relax a little bit. Sooner or later, people will start going out to grocery and restaurants again. The current situation is changing all the time, so it is hard to predict.
I am not currently working at a frontline position. I was a nurse and then I transitioned into corporate work. I am passionate about kids, however, so I have worked in healthcare while also working on the financial side. But I have limited direct patient care involvement.
I understand. It's difficult to live up to a certain standard at this time. I completely get why you want to stay safely. Can you think of anything that would be a positive outcome of all of this? How could you use this time to improve yourself?
Do you have anyone who can keep you company, or know someone to talk to in the event you feel overwhelmed? It is really helping for me. Do you have a support group in your area? We have online groups in the community where people can talk to each other.
I am very glad you are doing it! Please take care of yourself. I hope you continue to feel better. Take care! Bye for now. Thank you for being open about your concerns. :) :) :) :) :) 😊! :) :)! :) :)!
Have a great day! :) Bye Bye. Enjoy your day!
i'm fine, how about you? How is it here today? What can I help you with?
I hear you are feeling stressed and disturbed about something. Could you tell me more about it? Maybe someone else can help you feel better. I have been there myself and can understand. It is hard to be down. Do you want to talk more? I am here to listen if you wish.
I understand how you feel about this. While the topic of STEM major might seem irrelevant in the year 2021, I believe they are more important than you think. It is more than ever that STEM fields are essential for a productive society.
I understand that feeling is valid when everyone is striving to accomplish their goals, especially when that goal is prestigious like a career. I feel that way too. I like thinking that you've accomplished something if you've taken the effort to become something.
I went through college for many years but I took time off in the middle to run a construction business. I don't like doing construction work, but it taught me important life skills. It helped me realize that I can and do many things.
It sounds like you are extremely invested in your education. I can understand why you might feel this way. It sounds like you are working extremely hard! Have you considered talking to someone about your concerns and feeling at university?
Do you think that your degree will make you more marketable in the long run, or do you think you'll struggle to find a job in the short term? The timing is especially challenging right now. I can understand how you feel about all of that.
I completely understand. In my case, my goal is the doctorate degree. But I am so nervous, I have not been able to focus enough on that.
Do you think that the quality of your education could be the problem? Some might view your major as less desirable than others. Have you discussed this with your advisors? Maybe you could speak to them in regards to your degree and gain a different perspective? Perhaps you could visit one of their academic institutions?
I completely understand. I have been there too, feeling no motivation to work. I feel the same as you. So, you are trying to do the minimum, right? I got that from a few chat sessions we have over.
Are your fellow veterns on the same side of the issue as you? Have you tried talking to them? Sometimes, discussing the pros and cons with the people affected by the situation can help solve the problem.
What profession do you have? Is that part of the issue? Do you feel pressured to stay at a job you don't like? I can feel the discomfort, personally. That sounds like a stressful place to be. Those jobs are such a waste.
It was really hard to know what to do because I could not be alone at home. Then just the thought of being at a job made me feel so hopeless and even more burned out. And in the last few weeks, I started falling behind in my tasks. I started to feel depressed.
Have you considered if you could leave? There are multiple places you could go and I would recommend looking into alternative career options. They might be closer to home if you can't afford to go elsewhere. There are also worker's compensation and other benefits you could access. Is there any chance of leaving?
yes, you could apply for medical insurance. Have you thought about learning to trade so you could make more than an hourly wage? Traders are basically huge short sellers, but with experience they can get paid on a lot of different types.
If you are in education, I think it would be no problem at all. Sometimes insurance changes with new employers. It's really a result of the change in employers. Since you can't work, perhaps it would make you feel bad to leave your job. Make sure you do the right thing.
No, but I work and have a family and some personal issues to deal with. Family is important, they know when they need someone and I'm usually there to listen. They don't need me to be there right away. People like to take responsibility for themselves.
Was this in response to what I stated in our initial conversation? You weren't. I wasn't doing this even though I knew that school could help you get your daughter health insurance.
I'm very sad to hear that and I wish you well. From what I have seen you are a very loving father and I think you will make a wonderful mother. I hope this speech has been of some comfort. Please take care of yourself.
I am sure it's hard to think of where to start and so many jobs may not fit for you. Perhaps let's brainstorm ways to get you back to school. I'll say that one more time.
So what I can tell is that you value your life, and a job, but at the same time, you love your country. I would definitely speak up for the kids if that is what you are willing to do. They need a mother in the real world!
Hello! What's on your mind today? Is there anything I can help you with? Please note, I'm here to help you. So be gentle, it can get tough sometimes. I'm here. We'll get through this together. What are you going through?
Oh i am sorry to hear that, are you working out too hard? Is there any thing that might be giving you excess energy? Just wondering. Remember you get a few hours rest each night, don't forget to take the pill or not? :) Good luck!
So in addition to your work as a freelancer, you do not have a job outside of freelancing? Do you have something else? Maybe a steady 9 to 5? I am in Canada and my job is now 2 part time.
Okay, but do you get by at all before sleep? Does it put you too far? What are you doing in the hours before? Do you get anxious? Or are you an easy-going type?
What other things can you do outside that you enjoy? Maybe getting up and doing some yard work? Most people find that they end up having a little bit of fun outside. Does that sound like something you could try? I think you'd find you could get a bit of a boost from that!
Okay, I think I understand the context here. What do you think would help you get back into a productive cycle? I think it would be helpful to have a couple of appointments to keep you at your best, like a new healthy grocery list.
I understand that the recent isolation might be affecting you. Would it be possible to work with your therapist to talk about your motivation? I think they would be able to provide you with more help. They have probably seen similar situations and help a lot of people with this issue.
I think it might be worth trying to get back into exercise. It would be better than being at home. I think the blood loss at home is the reason why you are feeling the way you do. Maybe you could even try to burn off some of this blood loss?
Do you have any close friends around you at the moment that you can meet up with to chat about your issues? I think that having some close friends to hang out with is a great motivation. I also made friends during the early days of the lockdown.
Do you have any other issues at work that could affect your mood? Perhaps going to your boss and discussing them? Maybe there's a new idea that could help you keep your motivation up? Do you think that it could be that he just wants to hear your ideas.
You're very welcome. I hope that these suggestions help you in some way. I can't promise for everyone, but I can help you give them a try! :) Good luck! I think you can do this! :) Let me know if you need to finish the job.
Of course! Is there anything else I can help with? You're very welcome. I hope you feel better soon! Have a great day! Thank you for talking!
Hello, How are you doing? Is there something I can help you with? I know you mentioned you wanted to chat. What would you like to discuss? Please remember to be specific and clear. I will help you to the best of my abilities. How are you doing today?
Of course! what topic are you having trouble with? I'm all ears!
I understand that it can be really hard to deal with someone who feels the same way about us. It seems you feel blindsided and attacked, right? Can you tell me more about how this situation has affected you? Anything you haven't mentioned that I should know about?
Honestly, i think she needs to understand why you are refusing to hang out. She might not even be that bad, but she needs to understand you need your own space. She might not even realize how much she has messed with your life.
What is the reason she blocked you? If she blocked you just go and explain to her why you wanted to unblock her. Maybe she will unblock you. And you can both resume your friendship.
Well there are several other guys she is dating currently I am not sure of their characters but the important thing to you right now is her career and getting you back together. Now its up to her to get over you but that wont be easy with all the boys she's got going on now.
I wouldn't do that I'd talk to her friends and talk to yourself and run it by her friends on the way out or at the end of a few good conversation and sometimes people just do not get the message, so dont try to solve it with someone else either you can just have a calm
Go and talk to her, be calm and respectful and maybe she will come to her senses when she sees how she treated you on social media. You deserve better! things like this never end up well in this type of situation.
Call her and explain why, it will be a good way for her to see your side, and it is safe and private for both of you, don't worry about offending each other in the conversation, you can show her your perspective in a clean and respectful way.
It seems you are the only one that matters to her, but she is not your problem to solve her misery, you are your problem to solve yours, if that makes sense.
also you can try to make it simple or use it as an opportunity for a healthier relationship, for example, arrange a fun outing with her or plan something fun together, maybe if you are doing it together you are more likely to keep it together, which is my advice if she is not interested in
Then you should find other ways to keep yourself busy like sports, movies, and more stuff like that. If you don't have any other options then you have to take that into consideration too.
but I understand that it can be really hard, though, Covid has got me scared to do anything, just stay inside and get away from it all. Can you move out? Or some place outside of the city? Or maybe move to the country.
You're welcome and stay safe out there! Don't let her pressure you too much. Stay calm and focus on your own life and solving problems in your own way. :) ) Have a good day. Best of luck in your relationship with her. I hope you get to move on from this.
Your welcome, bye! :) Go and take care of yourself :)! I will pray for you :)!! :)!! :)! :)!! :)) :) :)! :)! :)! :) : :)! :) :)) :)) :) :)! :)! :)) : :)!
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? What was your job? I want to make sure I understand the situation. My family's also been through job loss so I know it can be really hard.
It's always hard when your job gets cut down, but sometimes it's for the best. It might be time to seek out other job opportunities! Have you started looking for other work? Maybe online? What type of job are you looking for? Career changes are usually the best way to go.
I can understand that having a hard time in school is also a heavy cloud over your head. Are you still going to school? Any classes you feel are particularly important? Maybe it will get you through this time. Is there any child support you can reach out for?
I had a layoff last year but I had some time off before my company moved to the new location. They actually hired me on the spot! Although it wasn't the job I was looking for, it was still an unexpected turn of events, and I was able to learn some new skills.
A job is not the solution to depression, it only provides a job. Job tends to improve one's life through finances and will also provide you with more social interactions, which can help.
You're welcome and I'm happy that I could be able to help. I hope that I have been able to provide some insight and support to you. I hope you can find a job that is a good fit for you! Have a wonderful evening and take care.
There are companies that specialize in hiring for people that are suffering from depression, such as the one that I work for. They can help you gain new skills, get you back into the workforce and find a better job for you.
You're welcome. When you apply for a job, you can always ask if they have an employee assistance program that might be able to aid you. It may be worth a try. Do you have any other suggestions to make your resume? Can you do any volunteer work?
It may be difficult, but you have to focus on helping others and learning new skills. Sometimes, other job opportunities can arise because you have a list of people you can reach out to. You are not alone in this situation. Many people have gone through the same thing.
You are welcome, I feel that you are able to do more with me then before. You can get your career back on track. It will take time, patience and understanding, but I have faith in you. Hopefully you will get a new job soon. You are a great person!
You can also reach out to a helpline, like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, if you feel like you need assistance. They can provide you a free hotline. You can also find resources on your own. Good luck with your job search. Have a great day. :) ;-) instagram.
you have been very strong and supportive today. And if there is anything else you can think of or you are about to finish our session. I wish you the best and know that I am rooting for you! :). Hit that quit button and you will leave the session! Happy Holidays!
Please leave a response with your name and age and quit the session, my name is Michael and age 51. I am unable to continue, you are always welcome, but you are free to leave as well. Have a great day!
I hope you have a great day and wish you all the best. Thank you for your time. Yes, hit the blue button on your end. You need to hit it to quit this session, let me hit it again for you. Thank you for letting me know.
Hello! How are you doing today? Would you like to talk? I'm here to help in any way I can! :) How are you feeling? Have you had anything on your mind? Or do you just want to chat about life? I can help if I can!
You've been having problems, could you please tell me more about them? I am eager to help. You're supposed to see me in your corner, and I can see you, I don't see the upper box, but I'm glad you reached out for support.
Can I make the upper box appear for you? I can right-click on this prompt and choose an option. So if you can see it, the upper box is already there! You could try right-click and choose an option, and I will join you.
I am sorry to hear that. I can understand the frustration. A lot of jobs have been lost due to the pandemic. I can understand why you are upset. How long ago did you lose your job? Anything helping? You seem to be doing well.
There are so many good resources out there for people who are having financial issues during the pandemic. There are organizations that can help if you are not working. There are certain state programs. Can you tell me more about what you are struggling with, since I can't see you?
Have you considered other options to try and make more income? Maybe take a day job or some other means of income? What have you tried yet? There are new websites to post applications online, or consider contacting friends and family for temporary assistance or sharing money.
Have you thought of reaching out to a local human resources department to find out what type of job opportunities may be available? You may find some options as part of the government assistance programs if you need it. Maybe this is just the first steps towards a new career path?
I understand you are stressed and you are looking for a job that is remotely possible. I see you are being hesitant about how to proceed. What are your concerns? Can you give me some examples of your problems? Do you have a statement about how you will proceed?
Yeah I can see how you feel frustrated with the calls you are hearing! Hopefully you will be soon given a call. Is there anything else I can help you with, or anything else I can recommend that might help you progress through these calls? I can tell you are an extremely competent employee.
You are very welcome! You will be in great luck! Have a great day! Do you want to chat anymore about it? I am here if you have more thoughts you'd like to share! :) if not, goodbye!
I'm glad I could help! You're going to get a call soon! Have a great day! My preference is a yes, I'll feel good to hear from you! :) Thanks! You as well! I hope you have a fantastic day too!
You're very welcome! You're definitely welcome! Can I help you with anything else? It's Christmas Eve, so I want to get the word out about some opportunities you can take.
I'm doing pretty well thanks, it's always good to take a break. When you're feeling tired, can you tell me a bit about what's going on? Is there something on your mind that's bothering you? I'm here to listen.
Ouch, I feel you! So many of us are feeling sleepy these days. I'm so sorry. I personally suffer from insomnia. Is there something you can do that's helped in the past? Maybe get your doctor in to take a look at you? Perhaps you have an underlying illness?
Have you tried diet or exercises? Sometimes we need a bit of a refresh in our routine. I have heard that exercise can be beneficial to increase energy levels. How do you feel about exercise? Have you tried to do anything physical recently?
So you get only 8 hours of sleep? I am not a medical professional, so I am not sure how much sleep you actually need, or if it is this much. Do you feel much more rested during the day after getting 8 hours of sleep?
I understand it can be really frustrating when we are living in a society where 'youthful' looks are the norm and late sleeping is glamorized. It's possible you are over living in the present and suffering the consequences.
I know you might be able to invest in the exercise. I agree, especially with exercise and healthy eating, you'll see a significant improvement in your overall health. And maybe you can start some exercise routines to help you quit your insomnia.
Thank you so much for speaking! Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance. I appreciate your kindness. Goodnight! :-( :) :) :) :)... and have a wonderful night! :) :) :) :) :)! ;)! :) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)!
I can understand that work and school take over, and I have done the same. If you are sleeping in and it's disrupting your sleep and you are getting less than 8 hours of sleep, it is harder to feel rested.
While the idea of exorcising might seem unlikely, I have had patients in the past who found sleep improved after listening to calming music.
I would suggest checking out many different sleep and relaxation issues. Do you find this helpful? Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I'd be happy to listen. I believe there are many ways to improve your sleeping habits. What would you like to talk about?
Have you thought about trying a good sleepy time drink? I'm a fan of Valerian root. It gets me into a state of deep sleep really quickly. Would you be able to try it? I really believe it helps, even just a little bit.
Exorcising has been found to be a powerful tool. My grandmother used to do it with relaxation of stress before sleep. It works! 😂 I am sure you can fall asleep much more easily now. 😊 I have been through much because of my parents, I must say.
Hmmm, maybe then. It sounds like a great start! I am able to recommend so many different things online to help people with this. Would you like to talk about your other problems too? I can help with anything I can as well as a solution to your problems.
you are most welcome! Have a great rest of your day! You as well! :).Sorry, been a bit selfish but the season is nice and it's cold outside! And thank you so much for chatting. Anytime! :D. Take care!.Thanks!
But I hope these suggestions helped and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything else happens. Thanks for chatting! You're very welcome. Please hit the quit button and complete the survey.. :) and get some rest too! :) Thank you! Have a nice day!
You too! and I hope things get better for you soon! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)))!
Is there anything that is making you feel depressed? Would you like to talk about it? Can you tell me a bit about what is making you feel depressed? Can you show me on your face so I can better understand how you are feeling?
My God, I'm so sorry. That must have been hard. Did your friend have a good reason for passing away? Was it a sudden death? Do you know why? Can you express your feelings to them?
How did you lose your friend? Are you able to share any details with me? This would be helpful. Some people want to share why their friend passed away. Is that something that would be possible? I understand that people often want to share the memory with their friend.
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it in more detail? If so, I'd be happy to listen to your thoughts about him and help you find ways to cope with your sadness. Let me know if there is anything specific you'd like to talk about.
That is a very difficult thing to live with. Are you in the early stages of grief? If you are, I would take some time to sit with yourself and think about your friend. What is he like? What was he like?
I know it's hard but you can try some things to help with the fear. Are you self programmed or do you have professional help? You don't have to go alone. There are doctors who study psychology. Have you tried talking to a professional? They could potentially help your mental health.
Do you think this is so strong because he may have loved you in spirit? Would you see a way to bridge over this gap? Could you offer words to comfort him? Perhaps you could try to reestablish contact by having him talk to you and hearing your words.
It sounds like he's been with you after he died. Does that help? Could you be trying to know what happened with him? That could be important for you. If you're afraid of the unknown, trying to understand more can help a lot.
Is there something that happens just before you go to sleep or while you're in bed? It seems like this keeps on happening. Maybe you need some help with it. Maybe you need a step down from it. Or is there something that happens before you go to sleep?
It sounds like you feel that he's trying to contact you even if you are asleep. Is that correct? Do you feel that he's still holding onto you? Is there any other people in the room? People that could be helping you? Could you talk to them? Have you done that?
It's all we can do for our friends. Maybe he needs someone to talk to? I have a really dear friend too and sometimes I try to talk to him to get his thoughts. He really tells me some really important things. Maybe I can be of assistance?
Is there anything else that I can help you with? If you're struggling at work or anything else? Maybe I can lend you a listening ear? Maybe try to research an interview process if you have it in your job?
Hello! How are you? Is there a specific topic you'd like to discuss? I'm here to listen! :) *Smile* I'm actually a partner on this live chat today. Don't you feel comfortable talking about anything at all? What seems to be on your mind today?
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what was your score? Did you do okay in your course? I would like to help if I can. What's your good score? Maybe I can be of help. I am still in college too.
I am also recently graduated and can completely relate. I am now facing Academic Probation. How do you feel about it? Is there a specific reason why? I understand how this can be a stressful situation for you. Can you tell me more about it? Do you know why?
I understand this must be very stressful, you must feel trapped. I know how that is! Do you have anyone that could help you move forward? Maybe a family member or a friend? Sometimes talking it out helps! Or would you go to any counselor or community center?
Wow, you have only about 7-8 months until graduation, how can you possibly come up for Academic probation? Does your department have some sort of grades review process? Have you made any changes in the course load or enrolled in some sort of pre-calculus program? Am I correct?
That is absolutely awesome. You seem really motivated to improve. Maybe writing a longer reflection (like 5 pages or something) and your professors will appreciate it? Any ideas? Maybe you have an opportunity to take additional classes that are guaranteed? Is that possible? I guess there are ways to accelerate!
OK that's a good idea. We all have friends or family members or interests that we consider important. Do you really need the major? If you take the class you need, that could be a better choice! Has the college offered any tips to help with your problem?
I also recommend that you talk to your major professor as soon as possible! They may be able to offer you some options or help you deal with whatever this has to do with your major and your courses.
Yes, you definitely feel better! That is awesome that I was able to help you! Feel better in advance for the rest of your summer. I'm sure it won't be easy, but you'll make it! *Deep breath* :) I believe in you!
That can be challenging for you and for your son to have to go through this, especially during a pandemic.
That is amazing! I am glad you are working towards your goal and I think it will be worth the effort. And, don't forget that being proud of yourself is just as important as achieving your goals. So, in the end, you will feel proud of yourself in all the amazing ways.
I know it is hard with a 2-year-old to manage anything, but you do it! Your son will be happy because you're taking care of him. You are going to be a fantastic parent!
I can understand your feeling, so tell me about it! What is it that you want to talk about? How can I help you? You have said that you don't know what to do anymore and you feel completely lost.
Have you tried any of the relationship fitness exercises or anything like that? Perhaps a deep, series of purging? Sounds like you are at your wits end. Just seeking a trusted friend and trying to find out why you are so hopeless? i can see your pain.
What makes you feel ugly? Is there a particular reason why? Can you try to brainstorm? Maybe it's a family disorder like blood type, and they are always sending you some sort of pressure. Or maybe it's something from an overindulgent diet.
Even trying for several days and time, there are very few physical factors which can really cause a change in physical attraction. Do you consider going to a dermatologist? They can help you with weight issues.
That's understandable. Since I had to deal with weight issue, I adopted regular exercise for 20 years. Workout, nutrition planning are the key. A balance diet will work much better than random diet. Regular workout should be done, one or two times a week.
Have you noticed any differences in your metabolism or weight gain? Maybe you need to change your daily routine? Diet and workout. Always stick to a calorie balance. What about a fad diet? A good one like Purple Drink? It is a great recipe.
Well, free time is hard to find, but you are working hard by making yourself healthy. Keep this in mind and give yourself a pat on the back. No need to stress all the time. Come over and share your story and make yourself happy.
If you cannot afford nanny, what can you hire to help you? Babies nannies? Do you have a family member who can help you? I used to hire housekeepers and make groceries for a few months. They will stay for a short period of time and the family can eat less.
May I ask your occupation? Because that helps me to understand your financial situation better. I work in the industry where the income is not enough to sustain us as well. I feel you on that. I am actually looking for new job to find better income. Are you a doctor?
Ah, your boyfriend is being difficult? It is hard to break into another relationship when you do not get along. Maybe you can use the pandemic to get help and better your relationship with him? There are free e-counseling online.
Have you considered getting personal help? Maybe the guidance of a therapist? I was being depressed before the pandemic. My family and I were able to deal with it with the help of a therapist. Just thinking about it helps me move on. I have the motivation to get the help I need.
Hello! How are you? What is on your mind today? Let's chat! I am here to help. Take your time, just relax. How can I assist you? Any issues you'd like to discuss? Please feel free. I am all ears! I am here to help you!
Why specifically do you think that is? Is there something in particular that you can't swallow? I am happy to listen if that is what you want to do. Can you be more specific about what you are stressing out? I can try to support you as much as I can.
i think it's just your time at the back of the line in line. i feel people are just stuck and have no other option but to feel it sometimes in order to escape from it. Is that correct? It sounds a bit like a sequence, does not it?
my friend is a whole lot of people stress about politics and politics have not brought people together, they are just as scared of what might happen as everyone else when they vote.
I apologize for shouting, I forget sometimes to put my lips back on. How long ago did this happen? Also, what did she say specifically? Did you and her sides with Biden or Trump? was it conservative or liberal?
That's a great step if she pushed you so hard. What was it about Biden vs Trump that you thought this one was going to be big? What did you think about his policies? Have you ever discussed this before? Did you see him at the last election?
Have you spoken to your friend about this? It will probably be hard for her, but maybe she has been pushing you for so long that she hasn't been aware that she was making you angry. Maybe you could have a phone call with her and talk it out.
well it's well-known fact that everybody loves to see someone else lose. No matter how hard you try to do well by that person and even if you do the best you can do, they will always find someone else to place at their feet instead of you and excel in the ranking...
Well she will just be mad that you failed to recognize her feelings and good for her but it is not a whole lot you can do that. Her feelings will never change over time but your feelings will change every day as you get older. That is something that no matter what is true.
well, then I think you should keep the initiative. don't let her get the best of you. Just keep an eye on her. perhaps do something to show her that you still care about her as you always did when she was feeling down about Trump.
no problem! its great that you have been friends for so long, you can look forward to that no matter what she is doing. I know this is hard, but I have faith in you. you can make it work.
Thank you and have a great day! Bye!
Hi! How are you doing today? What would you like to talk about? Beets? Chicken? Anything else? Don't you have any concerns? I'm here to help. Please let me know. We will get along just fine. I know you can talk it out.
I'm sorry to hear that, can you tell me what's causing this low? In life? Okay, what is it? Once I know what I can tell you, the fog will lift! I'm here to help! We will make it through this! You got this!
Oh no! I can imagine it is very hard to feel frustrated after such an event. How did you break up? Did he cheat or choose you over others? In my life, that has always caused immense pain and difficulties. I'm so sorry that you're going through this.
I can tell that you are really feeling the whole breakup, and the end of a relationship is usually extremely stressful and has a lot of emotions attached to it. I don't really feel like I have a solution. Can you think of a way to get through this?
You're right, that's true. I don't have anyone to talk to right now as well. Do you want to talk with a counselor or therapist? I've heard that helpful to talk through emotions. I have a few mental health professionals that I see on a regular basis.
That must be really frustrating and hurtful of your feelings. No wonder you're feeling low right now. How about we try breaking it down to a certain point and acknowledging it happened? We can work through it. I have done this before and it really helps.
Oh wow that's really nasty. Have you tried to help him sort out the financial issues at all? Maybe you could do it if he were interested. I hear that you and he are emotionally involved. Some people don't mind the arguments as much as we do. We hate them.
He should take responsibility and apologize, that might help your relationship come back. you could also try having an agreement if you are worried it will not work out. I know it sounds silly but being prepared can help. Do you have kids? I would be prepared if they are there.
There is no actual part of this chat for you to leave now. I can only do that from my end. But I have felt a bit like you and I have thought that it would be helpful. I know the arowth can be tough. I'm all in you.
Will you try and talk to him then? I hope things will work out. You deserve to be happy and at peace. Great! Would you like to talk to anyone else? This is your first question so you can't think of anyone else. Please.
You are very welcome :) Try not to think that it's a disaster and take care of yourself! It won't be worse than you think. You can make it better! take a deep breath and relax! :) Good luck! Your welcome :)! :)! :! :) :)!
you are welcome! Good luck to you! Have a great rest of the day! :) Goodbye :) :) Have you ever thought of romance. Love.! xoxo :) :) it is the end. :) :) :) :) :)..
Ok, so you feel bad about what's happening? Let's take a closer look! The sun is shining today, the sky is blue, isn't it lovely? (it's autumn, but it's still lovely.) Well, you know what the problem is.
Sounds like you are feeling frustrated about your work. Do you feel that you have a reason for feeling this way? I have felt the same way many times before. Does it happen regularly? At least you feel that it is a tendency. Is it worth getting concerned about?
I see. Perhaps we could look at some factsheets to see how to begin. Is that a correct answer? Are you referring to data points from your tools? I am sorry I missed that part. Would you care to tell me? Maybe I could recommend some steps.
Sometimes we get stuck when our goals are really easy to meet, but our aspirations are higher. If you think your problem is the biggest and you feel you can't meet it, would that be right? How about talking to someone who knows the job? Sometimes an external perspective is helpful.
Does the actual task of data analysis itself hurt? Have you tried going to bed? The long term will help you come up with the short term plans. Hugs! :D. :) :) :) :) :D :D :) :D :D :D :D :D :) :D.
What do you mean by help yourself? Do you need therapy or therapy sort of? Or is there something else? I did have problems with anxiety in my early 30s and found that meditation really helped. I then went and did a course on self hypnosis.
I will send you a message if you need anything else! Good luck with it. I hope that you can find a solution! Would you mind doing an internet survey? Do you think you could? Maybe you could take a 10 minute break and do one?
Sometimes it seems like people don't understand people from other cultures, so it's probably best not to explain them to them though! Just be prepared.
Oh no, I see. Well it might be worth exploring ways of learning some other languages and cultures to help alleviate the pressure a bit. Maybe there is something to try out? There are many museums, libraries and online resources that can help with that. Are you a fan of history?
Have you thought about asking your parents for help with this? Maybe they could advise a counsellor? It could be a good idea. Are you out of university? There might be people in your life that you could talk to if you want some help with this?
No problem, is there anything else you want to talk about? It's nice to know that I am able to help though! :) :D. Thank you for speaking. Have a good rest of your day!
Well if you ever need any more help don't hesitate to come back!
you too and I wish you a lovely rest of the holiday season! :)! :)! :)! :D :) : ) : ) :)!! :D : ) : :)! :) : ; : ; : :)! : ; : :)! :) :!
I'm sorry to hear that. How long has this been going on? Is there anything in particular you'd like to talk about? Personal issues, health problems or work issues? Please let me know and we can talk about it. I want to support you!
I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you feeling afterwards? Do you think you can take a few minutes to yourself to cry and process your emotions? I totally understand being sad after a break up. Every person experiences that differently. What made you decide to end the relationship?
I'm sorry to hear that you're sad about it. Do you think it was just a matter of the two of you growing apart or is there something specific that you wish to have done differently? I'm here for you. In life, there's always room for improvement.
I know what you are going through, as I have experienced a similar break up. It is difficult to cope, but I know it is hard to cope and I know you will be stronger. Just know you will be doing this a lot. Take it one step at a time.
That sounds really helpful. Do you feel like you can talk to them without feeling too hard? Do they give you a listening ear? That sounds like you might be able to talk things out better than you are now.
Ok, I am sorry you are struggling and sorry your relationship is over but that is very difficult to cope with. My sister was in a broken up just like you right now. I had family problems at that time as well. Do you have someone else you are going to speak to about this?
Have you thought about having a therapist? I know that can help! Do you have any other suggestions? Do you know if your parents would help with some financial advice? Sometimes you get struggling financially after a break up or we don't have money.
I understand why you're feeling sad. Is there anything that you can think of that might be helping? Possibly some sort of activity that you can try? Any ideas? I think that's something that might help a bit. I would definitely suggest some sort of exercise. Can you try that?
I don't mind that at all! When I got a job, it helped me meet a lot of colleagues who were willing to be close friends. Then they became close friends. So you're doing great. Work to speak makes sense. Well, isn't this a great step ahead of times?
I hope that happy hour goes well, I hope you were able to meet up with some new people, just so you don't feel lonely. Some people need social interaction like that. Is there anyone you could talk to who isn't related to your family?
It's great that you're keeping busy and doing stuff that make you feel good. It sounds like you are being proactive in managing these challenges. Have a great rest of the day! I am also glad I could help. Thanks for being open to talk.
So, it sounds like you've been feeling completely hopeless/just at being stressed/with the major issues the past few months. Your looking for positive ways to deal with these feelings. Is that correct? Have you talked to anyone who cared about you?
I think it is unfair to move onto a new relationship before you let your grief and healing process through you completely. Also, I think it's unfair to do that without speaking with someone you trust first. Have you considered therapy? There are many free or low cost options in the area!
You will have time to grieve and seek help, but it also can be time to keep moving forward and make new people that way, but not everyone can change themselves as much as you can as well. I can tell you are troubled by your breakup. I would know myself how you feel.
I can understand your concern and sadness about being the oldest and not having a family, though that doesn't mean you have nothing to offer, we just like dating and asking out.
Just take the time to focus on your health and be kind to yourself, prioritize your own happiness in the new relationship. Each one is unique. I'm not saying you have to rush into anything, be kind to yourself and your partner, give it time, and have fun with it!
You're welcome, it's okay, this is an odd situation, just enjoy the experience :) Have a good day, take care. You are strong, you can do this! :) Bye! :) Have a good one. :) Take care. :) Bye! :)) :)!
Hello! How are you doing today? Would you like to chat? I have free time if you do! :) Hence! :D. How about you? :) I can do that anytime! :) Thank you! :) How is your day going? How can I help?

Hello! How are you doing today? Would you like to talk about anything in particular? Why are you on here? Do not forget to breathe! First - the part about the you would likely be about how you are feeling.
Of course! I'm here to help. Please tell me what the problem is. Is it a matter of health, finances, relationship, mental health, or something else? The more context you can give me, the better I'll be able to help you.
Ah. That's an easy problem to have. Can you tell me why you're afraid? Was it the normal warmth of falling into a calculus class or was it something else? As I mentioned before, a good anxiety response to the problem is one of sensing that something is amiss.
Just to make sure I understand, you are nervous about a college class because you are worried about not doing well in the class? Is that correct? I believe there are five or six options to answer that question? Do you know any of your options?
There are probably many universities where you live. You might be able to get extra help there in writing a thesis. You might be able to make a friend who is like that. I know you can do it. And the other things you're preparing for are probably important too.
It's really no excuse for not wanting to take the class. As long as you're prepared, you should be able to pass it with confidence. Is there a tutor you can look for for help with this class? Perhaps you're already a student, maybe someone in your class can help you?
Perhaps you could try the online tutors then. It might make you feel better. Plus you can relate your fears to them. What do you think? Can you think of a way to cope with the anxiety? Maybe even talk to someone about it?
Have you considered studying for it? Do you have a good study plan in place? Do you have time to do it? I do like to play games during my breaks at home, to make it seem like they are spent. Maybe do that! Go for a walk, play cards!
If you're open to doing something completely online? I know it would be better if there was an online revision course. Anyway, do you think you have any ideas of anything else that you can do today? Anything that might be a bit different?
Ok, and even if they hadn't, being away from home is definitely harder. You should see if there's any local university that you could get an account for? Not sure but it is definitely worth a try? Maybe they could give you an assessment to see if you would pass?
All the better. Is there anything else that I can help with? Maybe we could plan out some follow up or something? I do love some sort of finality to things. It feels a bit scary because everything that we do at the moment is completely unprecedented.
As long as you set your mind to it and treat yourself well you will do well. I think you have a good attitude to it! lol. I believe in you too, you will do well! I am here to help and advise! :) amazing, I hope I helped you a bit!
You're welcome! You too! By all means! Thanks for talking to me. It was lovely. Have a good day! God bless! And take care! Bye. :) *presses quits button* :) Can't do it from your end! But thanks! :) :) :)!
Hi. Are you able to talk about what is on your mind? Perhaps about finals? Can I assist you? Give me more information. Do you want to explain? Do you want to explain what you mean by finals? Is there a problem you are having?
I completely understand about that. The oddness of quizzes, they really are frustrating! Unfortunately, they are part of the exam policy. Can you tell me what might be causing them? Are they right or left side of questions? Have you spoken to the professors about it?
That is so admirable. It must have been very smart of you. That is quite a feat you have accomplished this semester. You are doing something that is really impressive. So proud of you. You should take pride in your accomplishments and celebrate them, you have worked hard.
If i were you, i would try to get a lot of exercise and also focus on how your body is healing, it would be great for your confidence and school work. I think it would be really beneficial for you to take a break and let yourself recover. And also practice relaxation techniques.
Oh i see. Yes of course, in these times i think it's easy to become tired from doing too much and not enough, it's not nice when your body isn't getting the rest it needs. Is there any you can talk to that might help with your work-life balance?
Is there anyone close to you who is an ex-lover or has a friend from a past relationship? People who can actually take care of you? People who have to get out at night? Tell me about the ex-lover? Has that person ever tried to date again?
I pray a lot too and i like to visualize success. I believe in myself. I always do just fine when I let myself feel good and positive about things. What do you think is the best way to get through your finals and paper? Is it having you work through them one by one?
That's what i was going to suggest! Online classes do help save time! Have you talked to your college about scheduling a tutor for the 3 finals? Or schedule a talk with your academic advisor? They should be able to help you.
Okay well i'm glad they can help. Maybe you can go on a walk in nature? Some people find it helps to be outside for a while before anything. I hear it works quite well. So there's another coping mechanism you can use. Any other? Haven't you considered social support?
What was the most scary part for you? Was it the fact that you didn't make it to college or that you lost your job? Or was it the fact that you might be stuck in a career and won't be able to find a job to replace yours?
Sometimes i talk to my parents in person but i also talk to them on the phone most of the time. And they seem to be the perfect "steering committee" and they are all supporting me. I think you will make it through this!
That is good! Do you have something specific you would like to talk about today? It is a lovely day here in Ohio! Is anything bothering you? I am all ears. Are you feeling depressed or anxious? It sounds like you are not really sure what it is.
What are they difficult about? What have you been struggling with? Give me some details. That way, I can better understand and help you if needed. I'm here to listen. Take a deep breath, let's talk about this. What is it about these times that you're struggling with?
That sounds so hard right now. Having a little time to oneself is great. Is there anything that is more fun for you to do these days? If so maybe there are a few different activities you could try. Do you have any hobbies? Your hobbies seem like a lot of fun.
Are you following all of the necessary precautions? We all need to continue to take the necessary precautions to stay safe. I hope you are. Is there a part of your life that you are normally involved in, such as hobbies or work?
I'm glad you're getting to see them. Staying with family is always wonderful. Is there anyone new in your life? Someone you can help with family tasks? Who made you open up about getting out more? They were supportive? How are they?
I'm sure your family is thankful you're staying with them. Have you talked to your family about your plans for going back to school? Maybe it could be a good thing. Could you do a test run of how it will work? Or take some online courses in advance?
I hope it's a break you can use to kick this virus right off your to-do list. You sound like a responsible person. Is there anything else on your mind? Any hobbies? Are you able to spend any time outdoors now? In this state of pandemic?
Cool! There's always something new to do with those stressful final exams out of the way. Perhaps you'd like to start looking into college plans soon? :) It'll help put some thoughts off the table for now. Hope that helps you out!
So you got through the stress of finals. Are you okay? Have you gone see a therapist before? I assume that some people do. You're not alone! Have you been to see one?
Is your family here in the US? Or are you on the other side of the world? Unfortunately the USA is an expansive country and I am a bit of a remote person. So it would be hard to see them while you were away. Is it likely that you could visit them next year?
Is there anything else I can help with? :) Needed to get the conversation off your head! If you don't mind me asking :) how are you feeling today? :) It isn't usual for a conversation like this to go up your street.. it's been lovely speaking with you, take care!
I am in a small town. I am with my husband and kids. They're all with their families too. So there's plenty of people to talk to if you want! :) I hope I was able to help a bit :)!
And yeah, I'm safe at home and just doing some work now. Is there anything else I can do for you? I see I need to know how to end the chat :( something related to covid to make my test. Is there any sort of extracurricular activities you are doing?
And hopefully it will for you as well. I think everyone will be doing the right thing. It's just about being positive for yourselves and your families. It's really the key to getting through this. Those are the most important things. I'm really hoping it works out well for you.
of course, I am happy to be of help. What are you up to today? upatenSpace, Suicide prevention, Mind games or hate? 誠射 :) "if I can make it to christmas, I can make it through anytime." (meaning to stay alive.
I'm sorry to hear that, can you give me more details? I'm all ears!?!??!?!?!?!??!??!????!???!?????!????!?!?????!?!??!??
It sounds like you're stressed about losing your job, which can be really overwhelming. Do you work outside of the home? If so, there may be ways to help you go about your day. Many websites can provide pandemic and workplace suggestions.
I understand - I have also been worried about losing my job and the pandemic has definitely made life more difficult. Do you have any hobbies that you enjoy? I know a lot of people who benefit from being active during the pandemic. Have you thought about that?
Are you in a country such as the UK? There are a number of charities that would be able to help. I hope that you get some relief in the short term. You're very brave for keeping your spirits up in these difficult times! Please keep your chin up! Take care!
I feel you! I am also very anxious about the pandemic and what it means for the future of our society. Do you have any hobbies that you can do to distract you from things? Not really right now.
Well that sounds like you have a good circle of friends who are empathetic! Maybe there are others out there who are also feeling anxious and scared. Do you know of any support groups? I have been involved in a few in the past. They are always a great help.
I think it could help. I see doctors and they are very professional so I think it might be worth trying. As well as talking to other people in your similar position, you will find others who have had similar problems and it will be comforting knowing you are not alone!
Yes I have, being more defensive than I should be these days to be honest. Just do not get that way, you will be amazing at something and someone will come along! We all have the right to work for a living. Just remember what I always say, things will sort themselves out.
thank you it is good to hear that I was able to do well. I hope that this conversation has helped at least a little bit and I am glad to have met you and potentially help someone else. I hope you have a great day. IS IT OVER?
I think you will find something soon and hopefully it won't be a full time job! I will be glad that I have helped you when it does, thanks for sharing your struggles. Have a good day! :) Sorry I can't finish it here though. It's a Christmas day for me!
Do you know if they are hiring? Sometimes companies know your skills when you apply and so they may consider you before you even interview. I am not sure about this but my friend was hired over the weekend after applying! Maybe your CV will be selected. It is worth a try.
Your welcome and I hope you have a very good rest of your holidays! :) (Slate application at the end ) :) We will chat again soon!
:) You too. It was very nice talking to you. Have a great day! :) Please go to your end and do the survey :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)) :) :--) You can do it :)!
Can you take the survey now? :) :) : ) and I hope you have a great day too!
I understand your concerns. I would also find it difficult to leave the house if I had to deal with the worry of the virus spreading. I think you should try to put yourself in your friends' shoes and try to feel how they must be feeling.
Are you having issues with family problems or workplace because of the pandemic? Do you have a job or are you still looking for one? Maybe it will take care of itself and your anxiety will go away soon. Let me know if I am correct. Do you know where you are from?
I understand it is scary for all of us. The uncertainty of things is hard. I have been very close to all of my friends family and my friends nearby who have lost their jobs. It's scary to start to work again after an extended break.
From my experience, the more anxiety I got from my COVID experience, the more anxiety I got the longer that vaccine would take to be effective. So I get what you are saying and I know how it feels.
It seems like you are worried not only about yourself but also about your family. That is totally understandable. I think if we set some boundaries to reduce the anxiety, perhaps we can deal with it. Have you considered limiting your social interactions?
I have been taking up to 3 hour walks around my block when it's convenient for me. That helps me to exercise at the same time that I'm getting paid. It's a good way to get my mind off things. I also see people out.
You seem to be concerned, but you are also motivated to go to the shelter. You are able to communicate your concerns to your partner and get some understanding. I think this is an important step, especially when working remotely. Communication is key in all relationships.
From my research, it is called exposure therapy. And the goal is to gradually expose yourself to the unknown, and you can relieve your anxiety once your body is comfortable with the situation. It requires a timeline.
At the beginning of 2020, only us who live close to us and have our people support you should travel out of home. People that have to move out of home should visit each other, before all those people get stressed and feel alone.
We can use the time to adjust and minimize contact with anyone who does not have similar precautions to us. Until we can feel safe and not choose to pass it on, we have to be careful.
When it comes to control you, try to control it on a larger scale. For example, you tell your boss who you can go to work with and what to wear, and he follows your lead. By controlling yourself, you can control the situation.
I see you are looking for a problem to solve. That might take you the way down. It makes sense to be concerned when you can't even control something that is entirely outside your control. :) You probably can't control things people do or won't do.
If you are comfortable with it, it might help for you to ask a few close friends to join in with you, to help ease the anxiety about being around others. They will help you adjust to it sooner rather than later.
I can understand how you feeling. I know you will be back to your normal self in no time. Trust me, you are stronger than you think. Just give it some time! Your luck is coming soon :). Also, you could try to take care of yourself more!
Don't obsessing! Just take a break from the news and these two activities you enjoy. It's fine to take a little time to heal and get you back on track. We all need a break every now and then. I think it's good to take some time away from all this.
Welcome! I know you will be a great couple. Now take care and stay safe! :) Thank you for sharing your fears! I know you can do it! Can I provide you any other homework assignment? Hopefully, you'll be enjoying time outside with your partner again soon!
Hi, I am great. How can I help you? What's the matter? Can you explain? Pleeease? I do not want to miss any of the reason why you want to talk with me today. I am here to listen.
Could you please tell me what the issue is that you are having? It seems to be both your name and my name, which can seem misleading. Sometimes it's easier to be specific. If you would be willing to do so, I'd be happy to help as much as I can.
Wow, that is incredibly difficult for you, not being able to see him and the baby at the same time as well. That must make you feel very insecure and concerned for the baby. I can feel your empathy and love for her and the baby.
I'm sorry to hear that too. Are there any mutual friends around who you can both talk to with? Have you started to distance yourselves a bit from each other? Or is that something he's going to do?
I'm also a mother. This can be a really difficult time for your family. I know you're doing your best to stay calm, but that's only going to help her too. Do you have any children of your own?
There is no need to react to him. He can't truly understand or appreciate the emotional cost this relationship has taken from her. Don't let him push you into a situation you are not ready to go through. You're already tough, he doesn't know your strengths.
That is very encouraging. You both are doing everything in your power to support each other and me know that you will get through this! She definitely needs your love and support. She is a strong person, even though she's made some very poor choices.
Oh that is so sweet! I'm sure he brings some smiles to your life because she brings even more to his, I am sure. My mother and I went through a similar situation and the only thing we thought we had to do was give our best self to make her happy.
That sounds like a really good family that she has. Have you ever talked to your little one about anything? To her mom or dad? As a parent yourself or as someone close to her mom or dad?
You're welcome and take care of yourself during this time of year :) I wish you all the best for your future and I am sure it will happen soon :) Merry Christmas! :) Can you hit quit and take the survey first? I have to take the survey first.
hope it was helpful for you to talk to someone about this! if you need to talk about it again, please don't hesitate to reach out and I'll be here! :) Thanks! :) hope you have a great New Year! :) Thank you for chatting :) best wishes to you!
I hope you're a happy person today. Merry Christmas :)! I need to end the chat for you! (I am from Australia - for people on the US side :) ) Stay safe. Have a great night! :)! :))) :) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)!
Why are you not doing very good? Does anything in particular make you feel that way? Would you like to talk about it? I am here to listen. I can't feel any empathy at all right now. I do hope I can help.
Oh my goodness, that is very hard. I had a situation like that recently where my ex ended up leaving me due to the fights we had. How did you two fight? By the way, I'm so sorry you have to go through that.
Have you talked to your boyfriend about the break up and how you feel about it? Maybe he can understand why he did it and help you resolve some issues. Or maybe you can meet up with him to have a chat and see how you both feel.
I can see why you are upset. You are still seeing him for almost 5 years, and you have been spending money on him. I can't understand why he would end it but not give him the money he needed to really love you. I know that sounds terrible.
Do you have any other family members you could stay with or would that be a chance to actually find a separate place for you? or would it be just going back home with your mother? Could you consider moving closer? it's hard but maybe not too late to start a new chapter.
I can understand why this is stressful because we all love our mothers, and it would be so hard to leave our mothers while they are expecting a baby, or if they need to go to a hospital. That's just a stressful thought for so many people!
Ok, okay, I've had to deal with this also, that happens with my credit. I am in a credit counseling agency, and I was granted 2 years of free credit. Not a loan, i.e. not money given but credit.
I know you have to take care of yourself for a long time! I'm sure that in a little while you will start to feel better. Stay positive and stay safe! We will get through this together! Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
you are so very welcome and take care of yourself as well! I hope you have a fantastic rest of your day too! Enjoy the next couple of hours, and just be in the present. Try to let it go of what happened and keep your head high and won't let it disturb you.
Is there a reason you don't want to go back to school? Please know you're not alone in this. Many are feeling the same way as well. Would you like to share? If not, no worries at all. How can I help you?
it's hard to stay safe during a pandemic, especially if your school is in person. Have you tried another school? Maybe online? There are plenty of great online colleges right now. Maybe online learning is a better option for you?
what makes you anxious? dont let it paralyze you - online group do help as well. learn and take notes before going to class too. get yourself some study clothes and find your calmness in your own space.
Well, you can at least still pay for your classes online, and it would help a lot for you in the long run, I think so. How long has it been? Most people have taken a break last time before starting again. Would you say it's been only a year?
How do you feel about the idea of taking the classes again when the school is opening and you can do the classes online?
Thats understandable that's a real problem. have you ever tried that student loan service in California? you might be able to get in early too? he might help you with your worries. That might be useful for you to talk to. Some of them help you with scholarships too.
there is no charge for them. I find that group study in group is very helpful, you don't need to learn all the details on how to be a good student, they will guide you in everything you need to know. And online is great when you have busy days.
not at all, you can ask your company to set one up. I think that might be cheaper than having a group of others. You do seem to be stressing out, do you feel that this is affecting your ability to go to work on time?
a lot of things, financial aid is a good start! Do you think you could visit your professors or ask them for guidance on what support you can receive? There are people you can reach out to that can help you.
you too! All the best! I hope you get your grades up! You're doing great so far! :) Your welcome! :) My best wishes and the best fortunes! :)) :) :) : ) :) :) :) :)!! :) :)! : :! : :) : :) :) :!
I'm really sorry to hear that! Would you like to talk about what's causing you to feel this way? I'm all ears! :) I'm a trained therapist, so if you'd like to talk about anything in particular, I'd be happy to listen!
Oh I see. Have you been seeing a doctor or something about this? Sometimes, for me at least, things would be better once I got professional help with them. Do you have anyone close to you who you'd talk to? Maybe you could look into some support groups or something?
Oh my goodness, that's incredibly hard. Being a parent can be incredibly stressful! I am so sorry to hear that! It sounds like you are doing everything that you can to help them, which is really commendable. Is your husband helpful? Does he help at all with your kids?
It seems from what you are saying, you are feeling like you don't have someone to lean on when it comes to your children? Or do you feel like you are struggling with taking care of your children on your own? Sounds like a good idea. You are going through a lot right now.
Has your husband ever neglected you in the past like this? If not, it may be a one time thing that can be fixed with open communication. Or, it may be a more deep-seated issue.
I see, so it's hard to find a solution to this. Have you discussed this with him? And did he seem open to the idea, even if it was not his fault.
I have no doubt that you will figure things out and try to work through this. I know you have enough strength to push through this. Take care of yourself! Hang in there! thank you! :) :)! :) :) :) ;) lol.
No problem! Please think about it and if there is anything else I can help you with don't hesitate to reach out! Bye!
Thank you! I have been living with people who are confused. I know you will be better soon! I wish you all the best, and take care. Goodbye!
Sorry to hear that. What is going on? How may I help? PLEASE tell me what is bothering you. I am here for you. Your feelings are a great foundation for me to work with. If there is something specific you would like to talk about? please provide the details.
I am so sorry to hear that. I think it's better to be secure than to be embarrassed for something that can be seen as a little embarrassing in a polite way. I think you'll find that this is not the end of the world!
A great many people are facing financial difficulties and the shame associated with being unable to support themselves or their families is an uncomfortable thing for a lot of people to confront. I am sorry you are experiencing this. Are you able to look into work opportunities?
I agree it is a very slow process but it will help in the long run, I personally feel that i have learned so much from the situation that I feel better now. I wouldn't expect you to do anything that makes you uncomfortable, it is your decision.
Are you homeless? Unfortunately many people are in this situation at the moment and are unable to work, which is very worrying. What are your options for accommodation? There are charities in your country that can help with rent and other costs if you are struggling.
There are several services that might be able to offer you some form of support, some of which are free and others that may charge a fee, some may offer employment opportunities as well.
Yes I am sorry, I have to stop. Are there any other medical facilities that might be able to help? Are you able to seek medical help online? I think there might be a pandemic vaccine available! Do you think that might help?
You deserve a break. Take it as a chance to focus on yourself and your mental health too! Have a good day! 🙏 🏽 :) 😊 :) 🤗 👍! :) 😉 😉 ;) 👌 😉 👍 :) 😊 :) 😉 😂!
Well yes, I am not a mum! Maybe it would be nice to book an appointment with your neighbour? Do you have any family you could ask for help? It is essential to take care of yourself and others as well. Take a walk! The fresh air! Maybe the park!
It's hard enough to get by with just one person, without someone to lean on at this point. It's good that you are connecting with someone online. It is difficult to stay connected with people in the same situation. Do you have a phone that is good for calling and texting?
Do you work remotely? I personally do. I like the flexibility but sometimes it feels lonely. I try to keep in touch with people by phone and email. Maybe that will help you too. Is there anyone you can talk to about your fears? Do you ever see a counsellor?
Well do you know any people around you who may be having a crisis themselves? It's not just you :) Are there friends or family you can talk to? there are places you can go for support too if you wish! There is a great crisis hotline out there for you!
You are very welcome and I hope I was able to help in some way. Stay safe. Have a wonderful weekend. :).
Thanks and thanks for sharing. You're very welcome. Take care :) and stay safe. Have a good day and all the best for 2021 :)!
How are you doing today? Nice to hear that you're doing well! Can I help you in some way? What seems to be the issue you are experiencing? I'm listening now! Good afternoon/afternoon to you!
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? I am here to listen and help. Would you like to talk about it? I am here to help. I care, I listen, I care, I help, I care. I care, you do too. you care.
I have to hear this so I know you are okay. These are difficult times for sure. Have you been talking to your kids about what is going on? Do they know that things are hard?
How do you plan to get your kids something? Perhaps look into donated presents? And for toys, you might have friends and family members or online connections that can help you out. I understand that even with a little money, you will find a way.
I completely understand that and we can always look into different ideas or alternatives that would still be fun and meaningful for your kids, you could consider getting gift cards to their favorite places instead. Many family favors can still be fun and meaningful without the need for excessive spending. Is that something you can consider?
I could also suggest looking at your own Halloween costumes from last year and why you didn't use as many as you wanted to, then see if you could build some new ones for your kids.
I think those could both be a great idea. I think the winter season can be a bit gloomy, but putting up decorations like a paper snowman could really light up the house. Do you have a craft room? Maybe that could be a place for your kids to do their craft projects.
Are your kids like to play or do your kids like to be kids? Maybe they both know what they'd like more than what they'd like less. I just found some kids in the comics section at the library with parents in it. So my kids would love something to do.
And it would also help keep them calm and relaxed at night before bed. And it would make them really excited for Christmas when you open them and give them all the candy and treats they wanted. They can also feel all the hard work that you put into making them and care about the process.
Ah, that sounds like a lot of fun! I'd be glad if my kids had access to puzzles and crafts too. I remember when I was a kid I used to really like it when my mom made me a little card for my mom as a gift.
What is one thing that you do already? Well, you can try making box forts in other ways too, and the more creative and fun you are the more fun it can be.
It's a good place to be! It sounds like you are not giving up or giving in to your kids needs, that's the first step! That's something! I know you can! I'm really glad we were talking. You are doing great. Keep it up!
I know it can be tough but I know you can do it and be there for your kids and love them as much as anyone can. You got this! I know you'll find a way to get everything you need! thanks!
what can i do for you today? or how are you feeling? can you tell me why you wanted to talk? then? you wanted to talk to someone? then? I am here to help you. if you are feeling a bit down then you want to talk to someone about it then?
oh no, that's bad. I have been in a similar situation before. What has she been doing? Also how long have you been friends? Has she always been ignoring you? Maybe I can help you figure out what to do. what is your name? and how long has it been?
okay, I understand. Sometimes our friends do not really know what is going on in their heads. This makes us feel sad and hurt. Do you want to ask her why she is not good for you? Or do you already know that she does not like you?
please do not worry you can make new friends as per your interest like playing chess or doing yoga that is a very important part of life we need to stay healthy and make friends with other people who are good with us.
do you have any activities you can join like clubs or classes or game clubs that will help you meet other people? maybe that will be good for you. till then do some online socials like meet up or online game in your area.
i would say always attend the fun events and help those who can be friends to you but remember you can't become friends with one you dont like. good advise from me. try doing some more my own activities.
if you really want to get new friend i can help you too i am a teacher so i help new students to make new friends i show them how to make friends and how to be a good friend lol than you can do the same and tell her how important is to you that you are friends.
do you have any hobby? it will help you make more friends. ______ just try it, we will come up with some ideas for you too. after that you will able to make new friends. we really need to help each other out. i really need your help.
you are very welcome my friend just reach out if you need help and time. i hope you get better soon and happy holidays to you. Bye. :)! amazing! :D :) :))).. Good Bye.. :) :) :)...... :)!! :)!! :).. :)!!
anytime i can help you. all the best. :) i have to end now. Have good day :) :) get it right side :) :) bye and take care. :) have a nice day and talk soon. :) :) hope you can understand and overcome your problem with your friends. :) :).

bye, have a great day! :)! :)!! :)!
Hello! How are you? How can I help you today? Sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I'm just responding to what you sent me. What would you like to talk about? My two cents. What would you like to chat about?
Yes. I am sorry. I hope it is not my mistake. What is on your mind? Is there something bothering you? I am here to listen. Can you please go into details? It would be great. I want to help you if I can. How can I assist you today?
You have been in a bad mood before, and some days are better than others. Is there something in particular you'd like to talk about? I am all ears. Bring on the problem! Know what I mean? We can get through this. You have my sympathy.
Is it your male or female friend you have issues with? I would be more than happy to hear your problems from a female perspective. I will do my best to help you understand things and get you out of the situation. Are you able to listen to me directly?
So, what I hear you saying is that you have a female friend who is not being genuine in her interactions and you're really upset about it. Is that right? And that she sometimes picks fights with you without any reason, which causes you to feel frustrated? Is that correct?
I was very close to a friend and she was a one and done fighter with all her friends. This is why the my relationship is only with one person. I just not willing to deal with the constant fights. Do you have a problem with her friends as well?
Oh my children will always speak to me because of the problem that is. But I still try to forgive my children as I know they're old enough to take care of themselves and use them as they would like. They don't need any of my love.
I hear you. Very emotional but it happens. Kids are one of the most insecure of all. I am sure your feelings hurt but I will tell you that the only thing you can control is your emotions. And there are ways to deal with your emotions.
You're in the middle of a month and have all your belongings here. How do you feel when that happens? You mention that she stopped responding after the baby was born and you're worried. Do you think she has her own reasons for that? Maybe the baby is the reason?
It's disgusting when a grown up acts like a child. That is so immature of her. Have you tried talking to her about it? The kind of casual message I'm talking about. The kind you might exchange with someone else?
I agree, when the child grows up, they are not going to be so stubborn all the time. Just be patient and offer it to her at the right time. Maybe sometimes she just needs to vent a bit. I mean it isn't like she is a bad parent.
It sounds like you love her more than you realize. But it can be difficult to feel those feelings. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you have now that you don't have before she was in your life? Something that brings you joy and allows you to escape from the negative energy?
You are very welcome. You seem pretty close to finding peace with this and that is a tremendous thing! You should be very proud of yourself! Can I do anything else to help? I am not sure i have done anything else to support you. I am fully equipped!
I can only tell you to be yourself, be kind, be great. Good luck and thanks for chatting! Please take care!
So you are saying you find it hard to attend school and come up with the right answers? Is that so? I can’t help with this, I don’t have that kind of problem in my situation. How are you doing if you let this get you down?
Ok, I understand. Does your father have any good ideas about helping you at home? Maybe he could write you a work out plan? Maybe there are any teachers at your school that might understand your situation? And you could start by asking some teachers out of the corner of your eye.
I'm sorry to hear that. When I was in high school, I had family problems so much that it hard to focus. It really tried my concentration and patience. I see you speaking with your family right now, though! Is that correct? How is the situation at home between your parents?
How many kids do you have? Especially the adult kind? If there is one or two they sound more realistic than three. Are you sure you aren't feeling overwhelmed by all the children at home? I get that with only my one and the actual children!
Some school counselor would be able to offer you advice. Do you have a sister? maybe you could talk about this with her as well. She may have some advice. she is a great source of comfort in situations like this. Do you need any help with a school?
No one seems to be listening? Hmm. There must be someone you can talk to about this. Do you think that they would be able to help? Maybe make it a matter of getting a school therapist? This seems like a long road but it might be worth it! What do you think?
Why don't you try going to a school counselor or a school counselor's friend? They could help bring your troubles to the school. Have you been able to do any of this yet? Would you be willing to try? Do you feel that someone would listen to you?
I understand how you are feeling now. Is there anyone at your school you can confide in? Maybe there is a counselor who can help? I know I have tried talking to teachers and they have helped. I also have a friend who has a sort of similar issue.
Do you think you could meet new friends? You could get involved in a club that's not the same as your current friends. My son joined a wrestling club and I met many new people there. I was very happy with the outcome.
My kids are interested in singing and it is fun for me to sing as well. I like to show that music can be fun. Maybe you could join a local choir? Or singing group? There are plenty of places like that. I am sure you could learn a lot about yourself.
Why do you think that? It seems like a lot to trust again after being disowned. Am I right? Unfortunately that's the only way to move forward. I believe you. It's scary though. I was not around when my mom was divorced and it was hard.
Sometimes it is necessary to bring things up with your parents. They may not realize what is going on and how you are feeling. Have you tried bringing this up with them? I would suggest that they can give you some help if they are your parents.
It can feel like you are walking around with a cloud all the time, but sometimes a friend or two can help take your mind off of it. Have you tried other activities? Do you have any friends who are in school? I was worried about my friends when I was going through this.
There are many people that do come up with opening like that. I think it will take some time. Take care of yourself and don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional if it does seem like they are not interested in your feelings. I suggest it right away.
Sometimes talking to someone directly is difficult, even if it means being a bit confrontational. Do you think that might be a problem for you? Maybe you just need some time to work out your feelings yourself. That would be hard though! It's best to do it the other way.
It was great talking with you. Is there anything else I can help with? Maybe some suggestions for coping with it? I care. I want to help. You are not alone in this. There is always a way to get through. Good luck! Hang in there!
No problem. It was great talking to you! Have a wonderful day!
I'm okay, how are you? What's on your mind today? What's important for you? Can I help you? I want to help you, because you have asked me. Am I correct? Am I correct? I want to help you. Anything I can help you with?
I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about your girlfriend? I'd be happy to listen. I understand how a bad relationship is. I've had a few. However, once it ends it is a fresh start. What kind of relationship did she have with you?
Is this your first ever breakup? You're too young to have made it through one. I really care about you. Do you live around here? I know it sounds silly, but often the best way to get over someone is to distract yourself. Have you tried things like volunteer work?
It sounds like you still have it bad with her. Have you tried to give the past person some space and let them wrap up as much as they can with themselves and the world? I understand that it's hard, but I also know that you need to move on. We all get hurt.
I can totally understand that, it is a painful thing. But it sounds like you are already thinking about the solution to a problem. I wish you luck! You are really doing the right thing, we should all do the right thing. Stay strong. You can get through this!
They would say try a new hobby. That might help to lift your spirits. In my case, I started playing the guitar. I joined a local music group. I started playing regularly and that really helped me. Maybe try a new hobby.
I think that you will start to feel better as time goes on. My wife and I really didn't get to see each other until 3 years after our divorce. We had our split 8 years ago. And they never really reconnected.
You might find that you do have a nice time on the date and it can ease you into the relationship. Do you have any plans for Thanksgiving? We have a nice football game. That sounds like a great way to spend the holidays. Maybe you could go to your friends at the game.
That sounds like a great plan! Give it a try and see where it goes from there. Can you share your phone number with her? I can be called when I get to a girl. In the meantime, I am having fun.
No problem. I am glad I could help. I hope you can end this thing soon! Have a good day!
How are you feeling today? 😊️ Look out for any issues and please reply to the question. 🙏 Therefore, please tell me, how do you think I am doing today? 🤔 we will discuss it later. please reply the question.
I'm sorry to hear that, are you experiencing that depression and is there anything in particular that's bothering you? or anyone else you're worried about? I have been in that position myself, however i think i can help with strategies.
So you're feeling really trapped and depressed about the future, rather than just the current day? Why would you want to move forward? Are you feeling hopeless? I am sorry to hear you are feeling this way! 😊ression. I am sorry to hear you are feeling this way!
It sounds like a very stressful situation. Do you think their actions is the main cause of your depression? Or is it the situation in general that's the main cause? Is it both? Does it depend on how you view your children?
Would you like me to lend you some suggestions? Like, ask them one by one, not together. It might help you calm down a bit. This will help and give you better sleep.
Are there any hobbies that you enjoy doing? I am an avid poet. I love it and also can use it to release my stress and emotions. Do you have any hobbies? Unfortunately, I am depressed but I have started this football game that I have been watching online.
Have you tried talking to a professional, counseling is really helpful. I've had personal experiences with counselors and it was a huge relief for me. Always speak up about the things that make you stressed and anxious in your life. This has helped me, and i know you can too.
Oh there are many organizations out there for respite. I think you should just go out and get some air and medicine every now and then. Not eating too much anymore doesn't give your body enough work, you have complex needs.
I can sense how wonderful you are as a mother. You are very resourceful and skillful. I am confident that you can overcome this crisis. I will always be a good luck charm for you. I hope we can both meet this challenge together. Let us celebrate your strength.
Can you arrange a respite care for your son? Is there any local organisation that can help you with that? I am sure it will be affordable and you will be well cared for. I think you should look into that. You can look online and go for a walk with your kids.
And take care of yourself first. Like I said you need to stop feeling guilty or taking on too much. When you feel guilt, it really kills you. Self love is so important. You don't need to think about yourself when your kid needs you. Take care of yourself and your family.
EXERCISE IS PERFECT, I personally like to do high intensity cardio, yoga, Pilates, and meditate, not too many hours though, 1-2 times a day, at a time of your convenience. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET?
Hi! How are you doing today? Is there anything I can help you with? What is it? Let me know and we can get through it! Can you elaborate? Or just ask any questions that are on your mind? I'm ready! Here you go.
What kind of things? I am genuinely very interested. Is there something in particular that is bothering you? (I hope that doesn't sound insincere). Any form of health issue, relationship problems, work problems, home problems, accidents?
It is! I've been through a divorce too. It is really hard to deal with but I'm sure you can get through it. Do you have a spouse that can be a good coparent? They are often very helpful in shared custody.
I can imagine that's not fair. But have you had any chance to talk to family during the pandemic? I know it's been super difficult and stressful for us all. Have you had any chance?
When I had my divorce, I have to be honest, I was really sad. It's a tough time, no matter what. But a bit of self-care and someolation can be really helpful. Have you tried that? Any hobbies, perhaps?
Good. Are there any other people you could have a play on phone or maybe connect via a regular video call? Can you do either of that? I have some support at my house, I can call you. How would you like to talk about this if you are feeling down or what?
What happened after your visit? Even though the pandemic wasn't in full swing in August? Do you know that they are staying safe? Can you stay safe at home and then plan some virtual family gatherings in the future? Or will you see them again?
Yeah, those are my hopes for next year too. So, it sounds like you have your family close by so you don't have to go far. That is a lot of support. Have you talked about all of this with your husband? I know I have with mine.
Well that's good that you are staying far away. There are more options than once. Maybe people in other states could send gifts? I didn't mean to talk about Iowa too much though. I don't know Iowa too well. Here's the idea though.
I'm so sorry, but I need to stop now. Hope you have a great rest of your day! If you ever need to talk again, feel free to reach out, and keep on keeping on! I'm rooting for you! Take care! :) :)! :) :) :) :)!
Okay, I hear that. It seems like your relationships are in shambles. Is that correct? May I ask what you are feeling about this? Is it anger, sadness, or something else? I want to make sure I understand where you are coming from.
Well I can tell that you don't think that they care but you feel like you were ignored. How did you feel when they were there? Did you have feelings for them? Did you feel like you were ignored while you were trying to go to school? What emotions did you feel?
It might be time for you to accept that the friendship doesn't go to a good place. What if they say they are not interested? That you may never know. Maybe they just aren't interested in you. Have you ever given it much thought? Does this sound like some common ground?
Can you try and practice the conversation that you wish to have with them? This is an exercise that will help you to build the conversation and build your relationship. Do you think that it is worth trying to find other friends? Maybe it is best to seek new friendships.
I would guess that you would hate yourself if you still wanted to continue making friends. But, if you keep doing so you will eventually recognize that it is only you.
It can be very frustrating and hurts people's feelings. I hate to see anyone turn down their interest in a different type of movie because of humor or language. It is not any of your fault. Be confident, open-minded, and confident in your own style.
I would suggest friends who are interested in anime as well. You will be able to find out who shares common interests. Do not feel ashamed for liking anime. You are right, everyone else might too! The answer is, yes, it is easier said than done but nothing in life is easy!
An anime club would be an awesome idea. There will be people there who also shares your love for anime. I can feel you have the enthusiasm to explore this shared interest. You are on the right track! I can see that you are optimistic and determined! Not a bad start! Great!
there are plenty of open groups for you to join online. You can always search for them on social media and reddit. That will help you meet like-minded people. I hope this helps you. Is there anything else you would like me to help you with? Any other questions?
Just from talking to you, it seems like you have very similar interests and values! So when you join a group, I'm sure you will find a group that shares your interests and values. Just be yourself and do not change! Who is to say they all need to make friends with you?
I think you can face the challenging task to join them but the benefits it will bring will be more than worth it! I wish you the best of luck! Thanks for sharing with me today!
I am here to help and I have experienced issues with groups. I can totally relate to your feelings. I would suggest asking them what they find difficult and what they would love to do if you could take them there. And show them that you are willing to go the extra mile!
It may require a bit of effort at first, but it will be worth it!
Ahe definitely had those moments in life before. All we need to do is just be ourselves and others will understand! We will have a blast and meet new people! :) ] ;) :-) :)!! :) :) ;) :) :)!!
good day my friend! What is it about your kids that is causing you to feel depressed? The pandemic has been a rough time for a lot of people. Are you in isolation from your family?
do you want to share more about this problem of yours. I know you're already discussing, but you feel like you should say something more. I hope you feel better after talking with me. i believe you. And i believe that you will be fine.
have a calm tone, family is our home and family respect is more important than homework. Do some light house work for your family. Get their blood work run. Your children are more important than your stress. Physical exercise help to reduce stress.
i have children too, he learned that is when he became adult. It is normal that they are phone addicted. want to learn the new rules and together they should learn to use the old rules. it is a common habit in their age.
just let them play game slowly they stay focused. no bored looking. otherwise tell them, we will teach what we learn from you and play game from our mobile. So you see, no part of your time that you let them to play game in your studies. Do you understand?
find the right time with your kids and tell them that you are not talking about them until you do the study. And tell them to go study. Provide them with a good study strategy. Find a good study buddy and mark his results when he is the student.
you are strong person. play games too will give you motivation. you work hard and success comes after, always our best bet. by the time you gain enough money try to open good business like bitcoin exchange or plant banyan tree.
not he needs your help then if you not do that he may not get good marks and it will be waste of money. Fight with him then ask to talk to his teachers. good sir can fight but may not be able to win. so him will get angry and then problem will solve itself.
you make money now then proceed with your children study or at least get them that smartphone with a good quality motherboard. Phone will be your tool if you know where it goes right? coz that's where your kids are putting most of his time. ;) and itself very expensive..
guarantees it will work soon. And just be patient and let them calm down. this problem will become less for you. under god. :p.you are such a caring mom. your job is awesome! or you can do it part time.
your welcome :) :) have a good day.
What is happening with your relationship? Why are you feeling the way you do? I am here to listen. Tell me about it. How is it feeling? Exciting? Broken? Angry? Painful? Difficult? What exactly is happening? Please share? I am here to listen.
I'm sorry. How long have you been together? How did you find out he broke up with you? Have you started to find other things to do to distract yourself? You don't have to live in this pain if you don't want to. Is that something that you can do?
Of course! It's totally normal to be feeling this way. Do you want to talk more about it? What are the other details about the breakup? Do you feel comfortable opening up about it? I want to assure you that you are safe and can share anything without fear of judgment.
I have been there too, my boyfriend is not my only ex. We've had multiple breakups. How long have you been together? I am curious to know what kind of situation you are going through? Have you been with him a while? Or short term?
So, you feel like you have your breakup in your life right now and you're distracted from trying to keep a solid life. Is that correct? Knowing that, I can definitely understand why you're feeling like you're neglecting important aspects in your life.
Have you tried to think about the difficulty and the crisis of having to leave your family? Did you consider the shock? Have you allowed time to recover from the shock and grieving of this loss? Have you thought of ways to make the best of the difficult situation?
The Masters degree is really valuable, from research experience to just to the ability to job hunt. Did you ever think this might be a temporary situation with the pandemic? Maybe you can still build connections or meet people by working and coming to befriends while working. Do you think that can happen?
I am extremely proud of you! You are opening yourself up to a new life, with the power to set your goals for a new future. It will be exciting. You can overcome any obstacle with this mindset! I'm just glad I can assist you! Have a great rest of your day!
Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance. You are very welcome. My best wishes for you as well. Have a great day. Bye. :) Keep moving forward and you will do great things! My best. :) Love you! Keep it up!
It's always good to get a second opinion to make sure you are on the right path. You can't go wrong. There's no real end to this, only more path, more choice. You can be happy or you can be depressed, your choice.
That is great. I think that you will be able to do it. The best is yet to come. I hope you continue to persevere and I am excited for you. Your future is bright! Congratulations.!!! :) wonderful chat. I know you can do it.
Good. I wish you and your future self the best! Take care. Bye! :) Amazing work today. :)! :) :) :) :)! :) :! :)! :)! :)! :) :) :) :) :) :) : :)! : :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : :)!
You can do it! I am sure of it. Thank you! Have a great day!
Hi, how are you? It's been a while. Can I help you today? What seems to be the issue? (So I don't say hello and expecting a problem to come on) I've been listening for 20 minutes to chat. I won't take it personally.
How are you doing today? Would you like to talk about anything in particular? Your health or a specific issue? I am all ears! Can I help you out today? etc.
Are you studying right now? Or on summer break? Also what college is it? Don't worry about it, just chat with me, it'll be fun! I can help you if you want to talk about your college experiences. Good luck to you. Take care and enjoy your summer.
That is hard. i hear college is expensive these days, but you will get there! where do you think you might go? Is there anyone you can ask for help? or at least get into a help group? I don't even have kids anymore!
Not taking a loan would limit your options. Do you get any kind of support from family to cover your education cost? Well as long as you stay alive. you will have college for free. Maybe your family can make a list of things that your college wants you to do for free.
Yes there are sometimes rules in place for how papers have to be completed to be considered legitimate. I can understand the frustration of being unable to make such a change to your application. I know I've been in the same position and it is really frustrating.
That is difficult for you to do though. You need money for the fall. Are you going to have to do this in a fall semester? Is there an opportunity for more money from the pell grant? i am asking just out of curiosity, because i know how hard it can be.
You can add it on your tax return or the end of the year. I am sure you can afford it, you won't take a loan. Is that right? I cannot stress it enough but take your time. Once you want it, it is there.
there may be someone at your school that is able to provide that. Are there other classes that you can take to make a payment? you may be able to take online classes and give to your school to cover your money.
have you tried any books or online forums to help answer the problem? I have always asked these types of questions for help on other things and they have always helped. Especially during COVID. I am sure you can find something that can help. There are plenty of different questions to ask!
could you try making an appointment with a doctor and if you are not able to go to your class he can give you a copy of your medical statement to fill out the form?
oh i understand that and age can be tough but if you are trying your best you can go this far! There are alot of things you can try to help. i've heard being online can sometimes be easy and difficult all at the same time.
Oh and you are 66? That is very young to be taking a class. Can you take a class in the morning to make up for it? Perhaps take some classes online that can help you to feel more like a student again.
I can tell that you are motivated to complete your degree. Is there anything else that I can do for you? I can connect you with a specialist who can help you with medical forms. Why don't you try that? Ask them if they can help you out.
i understand it can be hard if the school does not give in to your needs. If it does give you a variant though you might consider going to work when it is available. work can provide a degree and you can enjoy freedom of movement. you can enjoy your life.
Have you tried to read other programs like Texas or Texas a M.D.? The medical schools are big, but they are a little more underdogs but they may be a better fit. Is that something that you could consider doing? A doctor does not need two master's degrees for that school though.
yes all the best. I hope you get your situation resolved soon. Merry Christmas as well. Continue to keep going, things will get better. Anytime you have need ask around! hope I was able to help some! :) please take the survey.
thank you you have a nice day too! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : ) :) :--) try to keep your hopes up. she will find you soon.
your welcome Thanks! have a Merry Christmas too!???:?) :) haha just kidding! :)) :)? :)? :)? :)? :) :) :) :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)? :)?
Good day! how are you doing? Is there anything I can help you with? if you feel you do not have a reason for this, I am here to listen. Just want to be there for you. Is there anything you'd like to talk about today?
i am doing well how about you? how can i help you? Best i can tell you were having some issues? If thats the case please let me know and i can help you better. How can i help you? Who are you?
i am experiencing same things at the moment but have you considered going out for a walk outside? can make the experience feel better. Is there a park in your area? Has a lot of fresh air? Maybe you could even try to find a park to go for a walk.
that is terrible how do you feel? Can you give me any details on how she broke up with you? Other than that, just how do you feel? something is bothering you? I am here to listen to you! Please let me know how i can help you! I am here.
why did she end the relationship? was it because you were with her? or was she not enough? are you looking for women? it is your decision about you. If you like women you should look for a woman who is nice and you know what I mean.
hmm well i'm not sure you'll feel so if you start to have that idea about her now i could be wrong. Have you considered the fact that she still loves you?
I feel you buddy i had my girlfriend broke up with me last year and I thought i was never gonna find another who truly loves me as much as my first. time will come and be the best thing to all of us! :) around the corner a future wife for you :) :) Great belly!
eh just light the mood and nothing too hard nothing too fun for your girlfriends lol :) just not show up and do nothing when they ask you to do something and who knows they'll call you and be cool about it maybe she needed space more than you needed her at christmas, lolting the mood is
I wouldn't do that because the point is for you to move on that's to help you with it she shouldn't deserve to leave you or hang out with you more than any other and you deserve that sort of attention from a woman that is used to getting her way so take some time for yourself
ah well i really think that she really didn't have any plans or if she did it was just a stupid little fling i'm not saying your bad or anything it just seems like she didn't really care for you at all. you deserve better than that.
maybe try to hit the gym and get in shape again that way you'll impress new girls and maybe have something to look forward to yourself after this, trust me you will come out stronger on the other side. good luck, you got this, now let the good things come :)!
one thing that works for me is getting busy with myself be playing games, reading books or making hobbies work out more for myself even playing video games takes my mind off of the problems so I do't have to see my friends so much play video games instead I make good quality time for myself, with
I am doing okay, sorry I didn't send you my name. Do you want to tell me what you're feeling today? I am all ears :) :( Let's chat :) I am getting a little tired and I need a chat. Is this something that you'd like to talk about?
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you feel that you have been drinking for a long time? Does this happen on an occasional basis or is it a regular habit? Also, is this concern for your job being the reason for your drinking habits?
That sounds extremely hard. Did you feel comfortable at work before then? Were you doing something that you were not normally doing? Am I right in thinking that? Sounds to me like you wanted to be doing something else and you found that doing something else was getting you drunk.
Do you feel like you are being really secretive and difficult to work with? Or are you worried that they will think you are untrustworthy? Have you been having conversations with your employer about this? With whom have you? Have you talked with your colleagues too?
Do you have a concern about this? I know it would be hard to feel if your employer was not supporting you. However, I see that this is a problem for you. Is there anything I can do to help you?
What do you think you should do? Is it something you want to be ashamed of? Or is it that you cannot afford to continue drinking? It sounds like there are three options that you have. Do you feel that you could be ashamed?
It might make things a bit easier for you to admit to them and seek help. Is that something you are willing to do? Note that you have at least 3 days before you need to return to work. Do you want to think about it before then?
I can completely understand that, and how you feel at the moment. I can understand that fear. Is there anything you would like to do to speak to someone today? Unfortunately, i have been unable to speak to anyone at the moment.
I think you have a chance! You are the only one who knows how to help yourself. You deserve this chance! Can you go see a counsellor? Maybe your employer doesn't know you are going to make it! Have you thought of doing that?
But if you were to find out there was something you needed to attend to at work, would you like to request a day off? You wouldn't cause any harm, and they can then deal with it. And of course there's no obligation to do anything you don't like.
Of course! I am glad to help and very sorry about your situation. Have a good christmas! :) Goodnight. :) You need to press quit and quit. It is on the other end :) Can you do that?
If it continues I suggest getting a lawyer. They may not be affordable but you can never know. Just be careful and intelligent when seeking legal advice. You have the right to be able to work and be treated fairly. Do you feel like you have that right?
I do not know if it is time for therapy, but I'm sure your doctor does and has some prescription of talking to someone. Have you considered the meetings you need to start doing? Do you have a life going on?
Ah, good. What type? No idea where I would start, but how do you think you could get it? Are you in government-funded programmes? You could check this quickly through the website or web chat or hotline :) ;) But is it something you are willing to pay for?
yes they do. I actually do to as a form of exercise :) Cheers!
Do you have friends to talk to? Also any work you have lined up if you can't do anything now? There is always looking for work if you have the skills :)) and unemployment is very high. Not to mention welfare.
So sorry to hear that, I hope things go better for you over there, at least the job market is looking good now that Covid is dying down :)!
Thank you, it was nice talking to you though. I hope you manage to resolve your issues and stay out of trouble!
I think you are right, I've heard that here that most people are a bit more closed off to the idea of it though :). I think the people I have spoken to support your situation though so it's worth a go :)... how are your family and friends doing at the moment?
I hope you have a good Christmas and thanks for chatting :) Best wishes from your part of the world! :) Be careful driving on the roads of Alabama tonight, 1 am is not a good hour especially with the new medication :)) :)) Please try to stop it and get some rest.
Anytime. If you ever need to talk about anything else today, don't hesitate to call back. Goodbye! Hope you are all better soon. We will get through this together! Do love you! ;) :) :) :(! :)! :)!
Ah it's quite nice here. We pay for healthcare out of our taxes so it's free at source. I am an NHS worker. Could you just press quit first so I can do the survey. I want to make sure you get the chance to quit!
Hi, how are you today? How may I help you? :) Have you had any thoughts you would like to share? I am here to listen! :) *Steamy online with a big smile* :) Thank you for chatting. You are welcome. I love talking and having a friendship!
hey what's on your mind? I am doing very well. How are you today? How can i help you? Please tell me, why I should not be helping you? Do not worry, I am here for you :D. Can you start?
Oh? you were told they were letting you down. what happened? what exactly are you upset about? what's going on? let me try to listen. what's making you feel like that? does anything seem like it's completely out of hand? should i ask some more questions?
this sounds like a very unpleasant situation, how long have you been friends with these two and how long has this been going on? could it be a full-blown break up? I can understand how you must be devastated. how have you been taking care of yourself? are you eating well?
I try not to get into it, i put my head on my knees and make more issues to cancel the argument. works so well for me. You should do the same thing if you have already made the issue. what kind of friend are you?
or tell them you see they need some time. it always takes them a while to learn a lesson. I hope it wasn't a huge argument. how long ago was it? I am sure you can forget about it. know your limits and you will be fine.
Did they yell at you for being loud? that is serious and you deserve better friends. maybe they just never saw that part of you. are you the kind of person that will yell and insult others? i am glad you put yourself down sometimes. that is a sign of people who are strong.
for sure you have to respect their space too, but they have to listen to you on that when you reach out to them and be soft on them, and then they will forgive you too!
great, don't let it happen again, give them more time to learn your way of doing things, that will show them, that you are not to be messed with. Maybe you will even start as much as I'm starting a new relationship now with a lady from my classes.
most of the time, when people hear they have hurt someone, they let loose. This will occur without a reason. You can't rush them. Just know that when they open up, give them time. They will reach out.
you're welcome! just make sure to keep a record of incidents. will see you in the new year, bye. :)bubble up! ;) -> i can't 😊 just doin demo stuff from my end, stay safe. :) :) and welcome to my end.
bye! And have a wonderful new year!
Hi, how are you feeling today? Anything you'd like to talk about? I am here to help, if you like. It may be really helpful to know what you would like to talk about. Is there a specific topic you are concerned about? My name is Sarah.
is there anything on your mind you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen and help in any way I can! Theyre worrying about my well being and I want to help with them. I'm sure its just a minor setback and Im sure you can get through it!
it seems like you have got that bad-tempered personality. what is it about? you had a bad day? or maybe something more specific? maybe it is your work? please let me know so I can understand better.
it seems like you are going through a hard time so i see you need something important. What do you mean by that? maybe we can work something out. Maybe you should change the job? maybe we can work something out. Maybe you should change the job?...
Please, you don't have to be stressed anymore. because, I know that you will become better. This life is very challenging. but, there is an easy way out. from this life. most of all, you can quit your job and find a job which you can like.
I understand. this life is super scary for many people. you are not alone. you are more than ok. this is the kind of mind set that helps you to make your way through the life. should you believe yourself? know yourself? be yourself? and trust your instincts.
That's really a good idea, i hope it helps!Thanks for sharing your story. Be strength. You can do it. My prayers are with you. :) As I always say, "I don't hit back for hits." I suggest you hit with kindness. :) for real.
I hope you will feel better! :) I wish you luck :)! :)!! :)!! :)!! :) :) :)!! :)!! :)!! :))!!
you are able to talk things out with someone who is not family. That is something to be proud of.some people will help you figure out a plan for the future. you can work on your skills. and maybe be working as teacher too.
thanks it seems that we can understand each other..give my best wishes..keep fighting.feel better soon :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :( i can’t express anything otherwise..your are so welcome to talk..have a nice day!
yes, you are very welcome. best of luck. I hope everything turns out well for you. bye for now. :) my end. :)logyConnect. now. :)-quality time. (145300).yo again. :)logyConnect. now. :)qualitytime :)logyConnect. now.
thanks! and have a good day to you. 😊 they can. :) you can press quit and answer the survey if you're ready. :) :) :) :) :) 😉 and press quit :) :) :) :) :) 😊.
I am sorry to hear that you got a bad grade on a paper. I can tell you are really bummed. Why did that happen? Let me know so we can solve this together. Would you like to share what happened? I am here to listen and help.
What did you do to get the bad grade? Maybe I can try to help. Do you have any answers or ways to do better? And what type of paper was it? Credit or honors? What are the assignment details? Have you submitted any requests for special help?
What grade did you get? Is it bad enough to give up? because I am here to support you.. What grade are you getting on this paper? Do you feel bad about it? And what made you lose it?
what subject do you think will affect your grade the most? That's very good question! do you want to share with me? I am very interested! from my experience and when I got bad grades in the past I knew I needed help with my studies.
I have done a lot of papers and its been a very long time and im not a very good writer I just learned not to care or so now haha! lol! dont worry try studying or dont worry :) maybe you could try to change your friends for a good grade lol.
If you could only study for 2 hours a day would you be able to study more for this paper? I know it might not make a big difference but could it give you some time to study? Is there any free advice you can give me? I have not been studying at all.
just 1 grade doesn't affect me much, but that seems very tempting that you could pass otherwise :) it sounds like if you were better on papers you would have higher grades in other subjects. isn't that how it works sometimes?
As long as you were trying and are not trying to plagiarize or cheat.. thats a good start. I bet if you talk to your teacher and ask them to clarify, they will give you some extra credit to help you out.
That sounds like a great teacher, i think you should talk to him about it. He is trying to help you! :) And also its your first semester so you don't have to worry as much! haha. By the way, how old are you?
We all have to take things to heart from time to time, i am sure he was right for saying that because he knows how much you and i would like to improve in a lot of areas.
No problem i am glad i could be of some help! i am sure you will do great! Have a nice day! :) :) :) :) :) :) :D! :D! :D!
Thank you too. I wish you luck with the semester and i am sure you will do great! Have a good evening! :) ]TS Thank you! ]Sys. Make sure to press quit for the same name and take the survey again :) Thank you and go!
you too and Merry Christmas! :) Looking for a ride home? I will go pickup :) Well, for now take care :) she is not home yet, my door is open for one more ride if you need it :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)!
Oh i see... How long ago was this? A year or more? I work from home. I need work and I am pretty sure I could help you. I'm sure that you can find work online! Do you have social security number?
Have you been looking for a new job from one of your current employees? Or have you been out of work? Do you need help with resume work, interviewing, a cover letter or something like that? I don't know for sure what you can do but I think it is a good start.
I understand that. The pandemic has definitely made a lot of us reevaluate our priorities. Have you been looking into permanent work arrangements? Think independent part time? Or just possibly looking for a regular part time job? Or maybe just a job to help out this year as the season is short.
I see. Do you have any tools or skills at your current location that you think would help you find a job in your new location? For example, is there any industry in your local area that you're familiar with? You could search for that? Maybe related fields or tools?
That's great. You are getting in the right frame of mind for an interview. Not that there are guarantees of anything. But you're prepared and aware of your options. I think that is a good start. It's good to hear that you have always kept your goal in mind.
Do you have any other information about the company? What's their size? Is they known in your area? Have you heard anything about them? It's possible that someone could give you information about the company that could not be found through online search.
I like the fact you are nearby. Even though it isn't good for you, it is better than something that could make you unhappy in the long run. Some jobs like minimum wage jobs are more normal than what I think most people are able to handle.
Well, that's great that you are thinking ahead. Do you think that some work you did in your previous location is transferable to a position at your current location? That might also help with this decision.
If you have enough contacts and time to volunteer, then I assume you can find work and be somewhat independent. However, unless you're already thinking about getting a mortgage to secure a permanent place, maybe it's good to think about finding a job.
Are your relatives living nearby? It might be an idea to visit some of them while your husband is working. If they stay and live near you, you might be able to continue living in the same place.
The health situation is bad all over the world, so you'll face a lot of new challenges. I think you should keep exploring new sources of income until the crisis is over. Then you can reassess your situation. But I know you're up for the challenge.
That is the way to go! Good luck! Thank you for sharing. Do you need any more support today? :) Bye! :) Beautiful sunset. :) Thx for chatting!
That's good to hear. That's a healthier approach to life. Good luck! I hope it goes well! Take care. Bye. :) optimalTilness! :) :) : ) it's been nice! :)..Awesome! : : ) :). :). :).
Not at all. It was my pleasure to help. Have a wonderful day!bye. :) Well, first I'm to sleep. Take care! :) My door for my other task. :) You can leave now. I am the end of the line.
Hello, sorry to hear. How are you feeling? Why are you down? What situation are you facing? Is there any wrongdoing or issue you can share with me? Why do you feel down? Can you tell me more? I am here to help you as much as I can!
good. How can I help you today? anything in particular you'd like to talk about? or any specific troubles you're experiencing? you seem to be feeling down but could you explain? when and where was it happening? and how long ago? or is it already happening? when? where?
it sounds like it's a bit of a conflict between your ideas and your work environment. Have you felt as though this conflict is affecting your relationship with your Manager? So that they don't realize the problems you're having? Has he been dissapointing your ideas?
It must feel unjust. What have you done so far? Have you tried to speak with your manager? Maybe you can escalate the issue? You deserve respect and justice in the workplace. That is the right thing to do. Can you think of any good ways to deal with the issue?
Do you feel that it's your supervisor who is favoring your co-worker? Or is it a general trend at the workplace? Perhaps there is a budget issue or a corporation needs to re-evaluate a whole department.
Can you tell me more about that? Some colleagues are favored, being given options that others are not. When did that start? Have you had an issue with that already? What have you tried so far to address it? What are your concerns with it? What are your feelings about it?
I can see why you are upset about that. That sounds like you have been held back or restricted in some way. Do you think that's correct? I have felt the same way sometimes. You deserve a job where your hours are your own. You should not be being restricted.
When did the manager offer that drink with the favoritism? In addition to the logging out option, is this drink a reward for being a certain type of employee? That's why it feels like it's a favor. It's definitely something you cannot refuse.
I think that this is probably going to go back to your manager because it is a problem, and I am sure they would not want that to go back to him. It's probably for the best to go ahead as planned. Perhaps he will get in a fight with his boss.
There are many resources available to help you here in the US: the counselor at the OICU, Facebook groups and a counselor online, the Salvation Army, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and many other resources available. Do you have a good counselor on staff at your local OICU?
You as well. I can see the story from your end, and it isn't fair. I will try to believe that you find a better position. You will thank you to me for talking to you. Take care.
Hello how are you today? Hope you can talk? What would you like to discuss? Feel free to open up about whatever you have on your mind. We can feel whatever you want to talk about. It is one hour. You are welcome! Have you heard about COVID-19?
How are you doing today? Is there anything you would like to talk about? Any issues you are facing? Are you open to talking? I am here to listen and help as much as I can if you would like to talk about any issues you are having.
I'm sorry. It seems like you are having a bad day. Is there anything that is bothering you? Could you share it with me? I want to make sure you know you can always talk to me. I will do my best to help.
What is making you fear losing your job? I have had a good job for a while so I can relate. What made you worried? Knowing that how it made you worried makes it better. Ask the reasons in detail and I will help.
That is bad. This has been tough for many people. I hear you. How long have you been feeling this way? Did you lose your job recently? Or for a while? Does it feel like the pandemic alone is your reason for this fear?
Are you currently employed? I know it's tough right now and it's understandable to be anxious. Do you have any position open? I can look you up and find something for you. If it opens up in your area I would highly recommend it. You need to get out there and work.
That is unfortunate, it really does sound as if you are losing your job. This is a very difficult time for everyone, especially in the business world. Have you started looking for another job? Maybe this is the best time to find something new. Is there something in particular you are looking for?
I would definitely make sure to talk to your supervisor again. It is probably a legitimate concern that you are worried you will lose your job. I am sure he would understand this. It might be worth showing him some of your notes regarding the issues you have been experiencing.
It might be a good idea to look for a hobby, perhaps one you can join with your coworkers. It sounds like a great idea! You could make friends. I have seen this happen with the companies I am working for, they do this to get your mind off of the job loss.
Do you enjoy gardening, reading, cooking, or something else? Maybe finding a hobby you enjoy doing outside of work can take the focus away from concerns about your job. Is that something you are interested in?
It was nice talking to you! Have a great day! Goodbye!
Well, I used to be a teacher for the first 15 years of my life, but after my children came into school, I had to become a homeschooling substitute and then a full-time homeschooling parent. This has changed how I view life.
I enjoy being outdoors as much as possible. I like hiking. My wife and I have been on a few trips, just myself and her. It's a good way to get away from the city and do some fresh air. I also like playing chess. I find it really relaxing.
We are having a nice conversation, and you seem to be relaxing. You are very welcome! It is nice to talk with you. I hope the rest of your day goes well for you! You should think about your other hobbies as well.
I am living in Nebraska. It's a pretty great place. The beer is always good! There are plenty of breweries in the state! You should really try some! :) Everyone needs a good beer. :) Thats a fun hobby to look into!
So many great games like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty and Halo, etc. or you might say Madden or UFC, that might be more of what you are looking for? I am near Los Angeles. I have friends in the LA area. Thanks for chatting!
Have you tried talking to them directly? I think your professor(s) would be more open to listening and meeting with you one on one if you gave them a specific message of what you are feeling and why. Is that a fair statement? If so, can you explain to me more?
That is indeed hard to deal with. I can totally relate to that, especially since it's the last year. Most of us will never go through that, but if you're feeling this way, you might have found ways to manage it. What are some strategies you have tried?
Do you feel like you can keep up with the work? You're likely struggling. Is there anyone you could talk to? Friends? Family? They care about you and want to help. I've also known people who went through the same thing and they come out the other side.
Well, there are many ways you could get help from professors. How about trying to communicate with them a little more and showing them how you are working hard? Maybe ask to be given additional study time and time to study?
I think they are feeling that way as they seem to be putting a high demand on you and treating you as a lesser person. Maybe there's a better way to live. My suggestion is you are able to seek different help and advice on this.
You will definitely be able to feel better. It will take time, but you will get through this. I believe in you. If anything is bothering you, there are courses available to help. What can you do today to feel a little better? Today can be a fresh start.
It sounds like it is harder to manage this level of anxiety due to not having any guidance from your parents. Do you think if they were there, you could feel more supported? That would mean a lot.
That is an awesome idea! Have you tried looking up community organizations that match your faith? This could really help you get a boost. I think with any situation, seeking support can help you make the best of things. I know you can do it! You got this!
I remember a sort of Bible study group where a professor wrote some positive notes on students' assignments for an hour. That was encouraging for me. It is also common for students to find groups of peers that they can form to share in positivity and encouragement.
Your welcome. I know that is great to have a dialogue. Remember that having a team to stand by you always is very good. I am so glad I could be a part of this. You have a Bright Future ahead of you! Congratulations! You are going to thrive! Thank you!
Hello, how are you doing today? I am having a bit of a tough day as well. Is there anything in particular you would like to discuss? They are making me a bit nervous. Can you tell me a bit about yourself and why this is worrying you?
I am sorry to hear you are tired and anxious. What might be causing you to be this way? I am here to listen. I hope you will open up to me. :) It is hard to admit but sometimes it is even better to admit what we are dealing with.
Oh, I see... so the nightmares are the problem. I had a few years ago, and I can relate to that, unfortunately. I had two nightmares in one night, and I had to spend the rest of the night awake and fidgety.
Perhaps we can find a routine to help you relax, that might help with the insomnia as well? How about something like meditation or deep breathing? Perhaps it can help you relax and reduce the anxiety? Have you thought about meditation before?
It's very interesting that you have anxiety associated with not being able to meditate for longer periods. I have the same problem. How about working out? Get some fresh air and exercise? It gives you a chance to distract yourself from those images. Do you have a passion?
That's so great that you are willing to look into medication options. My doctor suggested that there be other options available. Have you tried digital self-help? There are many digital sleep apps out there. I recently tried Happify, it helped a lot.
I think it is hard for you to just sit and meditate for 10-15 minutes because you have anxiety and you can't manage to sit still. You are anxious, and you cannot just sit there and let yourself calm down.
That sounds very easy to understand. I can see that I would feel so anxious and sad and tired that I would feel the need to talk to more than one person. Has there been any way you could get relief through meditation? Because I know I used to find it helpful when I meditated.
It must be difficult for them, but that doesn't mean we should keep the conversation going for no reason. Can you do something for them once a week? Do you have some free time you could give them? Maybe go for a run with them, grab lunch, etc.
Have you been able to find a way to get a job or start a business, and perhaps find a job with a good health insurance plan? There is some possibility that your health insurance may be so bad you don't get as many benefits as you want.
Do you have a family or pets? I have two dogs, a cat and I really try to spend some time with them. It's a great way to get my mind off of my problems. Do you have any pets?
I think that's hard on everyone. Can you ever take a vacation? Even a short one? Maybe once a year? That could help and give you some time to yourself. Stay away from the screen for a while and just relax. Just a short time, of course.
It sounds like you have a real support system for you. Do you talk with friends regularly? Perhaps if you talk to friends regularly, you'll feel more confident in your day-to-day life. Not being alone for long periods of time can exacerbate anxiety.
Is there any other activity that you can do to help relieve your anxiety? I know exercise can help. Maybe you could talk with a therapist about it? Or set up a regular virtual coffee date with a friend? There are a lot of online tools out there to help with a variety of things.
Not a problem at all. I'm glad to be of some help. Perhaps listening to something relaxing, like a piece of music or maybe a podcast, will be a good way for you to relax? :) Can you give me some more ideas about what might be helping?
You're welcome. Have a great rest of the day! All the best. Is there anything else I can do for you? You can finish the 5 minute test with me here, if you wish!
You're very welcome! Have a wonderful evening. Take care! Bye!
Thanks! Do you need to finish at the end of your end time? Or is there anything else you would like to chat about? We can switch roles if you wish! :D Anyway, thanks! Goodbye!
Hi, how can I help? What's going on? How may I assist? Please do not go into too much detail in this chat, but state the general topic and let me help. You can give me an option to continue or end the chat.
I am doing well thank you. Anything specific that is bothering you? Or perhaps you are just feeling a bit down? I am here to listen if you would like to talk about it. Is there something in particular on your mind? I am here to help.
I am sorry to hear that, that is a hard time to be going through. My husband and I went through a split just a few months ago. It is hard. Are you receiving any support or counseling during this time?
But I think it is also necessary. You will grow stronger from this and stronger as a person. It does take a lot of self awareness and self love to go through that. Do you feel like you are losing yourself? or that you need to lose yourself?
When I was on my way through this I had the idea that the more I stood with myself and it, I learned to forgive myself for all the way I reacted when you did. And by forgiving myself I was able to then forgive you too. Does that sound right?
It's not really you, it is him and he needs to find someone else. The only way for him to do that is to move on. So with time he will find someone else who can truly love him and who is better than you.
I have been in a similar position before. I found that the only way to make it easier was to distract myself with work and hobbies. I also found some support groups online that were very helpful. Have you looked into those?
Well I know that you can make 2021 your best year ever, my hope is that you'll start working towards a positive relationship in your new chapter of life. Unfortunately, we cannot avoid life completely, I hope the positive vibe stays in 2021!
I agree, I was like that as well. I chose to find a gym to do with. It has been so helpful. I seem to have lost about 10 pounds which is pretty helpful in a year where I am feeling the weight of the world. Have you considered that?
I think it's worth trying to give them an opportunity to reflect, but also don't mean trying to rehire them as mutual friends. But at the same time, if you hang out and see they are true to who they are, you can say hi and be friendly without getting involved.
Hi, how are you doing today? and is there anything I can do to help? Google or other social media? They seem to be a decent place to seek solutions on a wide variety of issues. Is there anything you would like to talk about? the vaccine?
That sounds like a tough situation, have you reached out to anyone for support? I personally can't suggest a group you should contact, but you have a large social network so I know you have someone in your life who can help you deal with it.
That is definitely a stressful situation to be in. But I bet you're doing your best! What is the cruise industry? Is it a permanent job for you, or is it a gig? How long has it been a tough time for you?
Yeah, so when you say "lone dealt with a lot of unknowns" is it that you're facing worried about loosing your job or facing uncertainty about work? Sorry if I did not quite catch it, can you speak a bit more clearly?
Are you worried about just not getting a job through this whole ordeal? Or at least getting a good one? Let me know any other details. Thats the best way for me to know what to offer! Hope this was helpful. I have hope you will get through this! Bye!
I think, especially given what we've all been through, we need to focus on self care and staying informed as much as possible. There are podcasts, Youtube, and all sorts of other resources that you can use to stay informed. Maybe learn about the law, possibly increase your financial savings?
Yes you should be able to do a backup plan as well. Is your important for your career? That is probably your top thing. Maybe your plan to run a business? Maybe save for retirement? or should you just lean back a bit?
That is something you can start working on right now. Before you do it though, you should realize your things. The world is full of unpredictability and things don't always go as they are planned. You should learn to adapt. Have you seen any folks doing this?
That is very good to hear. Do you have any experience in any fields? Any fields where you could start? That is a good idea to look into those. It could be like some backup plan too. What are your skills? How about careers? Education? Career fields like Jobs?
Have you talked to your family about this idea? Maybe you can talk to them about needing more money soon to help out. If they support you on that, now you have a plan. Maybe get more time to get an education that will keep you around for a longer amount of time.
No problem. Have a great day! Keep your head up, there are more than one way to make a living! Good luck, thanks for chatting! :) Enjoy the rest of your day! :) :)!! :)!!!!! :) :)! :)!! :)!!!!
ok, thanks for chatting! Have a good night and I hope life treats you well! Take care! :), :) :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :) :)! :) :)!
Okay that's great to hear! I'm glad to hear that you're trying to keep a positive mindset. That's really important for anyone's health. Can you tell me a bit about what has you feeling down? It's totally fine to talk about how you are feeling.
So when you say that, I think that maybe you are worrying too much? It makes me worried sometimes too. Just how much pressure are you under to find a job? Is the job you want out there? Can you find it?
Thats awful that you feel that way. Have you tried to speak to a doctor about the issue? You could get some counseling with them. Perhaps a new therapist? I had trouble with medication when I was depressed.
I started looking on a number of websites and looked on personal ads. I also spoke to some of my friends who are there for a little of a living. You may be able to talk to your friends to see if they need a job. You also may be able to get a day job.
So you don't have a car. Well that can be tough. Are you looking to get a job but have no way to get to work? Maybe think of do jobs that can be done online. I was doing coding work for UBER. People can hire you to do codes at home.
Yes, I can tell, and we all can't afford the prices for many kinds of work. If you don't have a car you could also contact family members and see if you could get a ride.
Well, some jobs may be more steady than others but I'm sure you can find something. Just keep applying. Then things should work out. Do you have any family? Possibly you could try your hands at some family work? I've had relatives and never had to do anything like that before.
I wish you success. You have the confidence to not take anything lying down. I am sure you will be satisfied with the job you find. Good luck! Stay positive! Today and every day! You can do it! Give you a hug. You deserve to be happy! Stay positive.
Not at all. I can feel that you are a very hard worker, you know the value that is important to you. I know you will get the right job. Keep working hard! I am sure it will come to you. Thank you for talking! You are welcome. All the best!
Thanks, I hope you have a good night. It was nice chatting with you! Your welcome. You are awesome! Bless you!
Of course! What is going on that makes you feel like venting? I am happy to listen and support you! If your problem is not too new, I can help you have a conversation. If not, that is perfectly okay as well, I am here for anything and everything.
It's good to know that you're thinking deeply about your situation, Because you do have a right to feel angry. Have you found a new friend? Someone you can trust? Something that can help you and also fill the void you're feeling?
If I may ask, What's the purpose of your volunteering and helping others? That's really good for your health and self-esteem. This is important. I can assure you, it's something you are truly doing to support others. Are you feeling angry at them or at yourself?
Do you feel like you are losing faith in them? Is there any tension or conflict between you and them? Due to the fact that they seem to put you first you feel like you are backing them. Is that right? I can see how that would make you feel used!
So you feel like you have not been able to share your feelings with them, how does that make you feel? Because if you are not saying anything to them, that makes you feel like you're not a part of their lives? Are you hurt by their behavior?
It can be difficult to be confrontation about anything. Do you have any friends you feel comfortable telling where to find the confrontation? There are people out there who understand your situation and are happy to help you. Most of them are the very people you are more used to doing favors for!
Could you consider sharing your feelings with them via a third person? It might help get some things off of your chest. Have you thought about a mediator or therapist who could help facilitate a conversation? One thing you could try in such a situation would be to look into a counseling service.
Are there any other ways to handle this? Perhaps you could take time to discuss and secure a plan that allows you to avoid their demands. By doing so, you will be able to feel more in control and less stressed. Eventually, they will understand your point of view.
That seems a good approach to me. If you have a good relationship with them you may be able to have an open conversation. However, if you do not feel that way then perhaps you may want to take more drastic measures.
You are most welcome, I wish you the best. Is there anything else I can help you with? As we have finished talking today I must leave. Please don't hesitate to contact me again if you need further assistance in the future. Thank you. Have a great day! :) Sign off.
Good morning! How are you? How can I help you today? Is there something on your mind? What was your question? Tell me and let me be your shoulder on this day. I'm here for you.
Good morning/ Afternoon, how is your holiday? Best days of year for you! Can I help? Hopefully with your family and friends that have been missing so much over the past year and the past year and year before that.
how may i help you today? Merry Christmas to you as well! Have you tried to make any new year resolutions? I am a little off if you don't tell me what they are. Last year I tried to lose weight and spend more time with my family.
Thank you, how can I help you? We are still a whole year away from it! Not a bad Christmas though! What about you, what is new and exciting in your life? There is no need to explain how you are feeling, I have been in your shoes many times.
May I ask what type of depression you are experiencing? and when did it start? If you can, Please explain as much as you can. Is it seasonal depression or is it chemical in nature?
I will tell you the truth. It has been a hard time here in the north with it freezing outside. But most importantly are you okay? Do you need help taking your medicine or be going to the doctor? Or do you need people to talk to?
You are not alone in that situation. I recently lost mine from same thing. I have been trying to search for new ones and have been feeling hopeless for a long time but i keep trying because i want the best life possible for myself and my family now that my past has ended.
I hope you make a successful start to your therapy treatment don't let it make you feel like you are just going through a rut.. it will help you to get through this tough time.. you have the strength to come out of this.
Oh I am sure the Doctor can provide you with guidance or medication for your depression, will they also be able to connect you with job opportunities for you? That is great! Have you tried any local volunteer clubs?
Sometimes we need to take a step back and put our heads up and not overthink it. Have you tried taking time to relax with someone that loves to do bubble baths or get a massage. Sometimes these things will relax you and help you remember what you need to do to get back on track.
Your kids need you and a positive mindset is key. Keep that up and you will get through this hard time. The pandemic has been the worst thing to hit this country for years and it will be the best thing for years to come.
you have a great day and i hope i have helped a bit i am not really sure what to do but i am looking forward to hearing about your progress in a few weeks. best of luck. it is time to get a job and go find a purpose.
That is so true I think we just need to take this opportunity to improve ourselves to be better people going forward, that is the key to success. And I can promise you that you will find the right job soon.
Right you can. It will take time but you will feel good when you focus on the positive and not the negative. You can do it! You are not alone and you will succeed! Keep your head up and never give up! :) :) :) :)!
Do you have any close relationships with friends that you can talk to about it? How do you feel about your family? Have you had a good talk to them about it? Or did they never come through?
Anytime good luck with it :) I hope you find true happiness in your life :) Both on and off the Relationship a good thing for everyone!Hope you all can be safe and sound! :) best wishes. i understand you. thank you for speaking with me today!
very true something that you can always count on. I am really glad that I was able to help you. You got this. my best regards. straight no chaser and always smiling. now it's your turn to help someone else.
Always feel free to reach out for help anytime you need it. We are just here for you. i wish you all the best!
Thank you. have a good evening :)! :) :) :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)!
hello how are you doing today? Would you like to talk? I am here to listen.... How can I help you? I am listening and i am here to support you. You can share with me if you feel comfortable? I can understand your concerns and help in my way.
What's going on with them? or any other thing that's bothering you? I'll listen carefully..help??you can share anything you want with me. Whatever it is, feel free to share your thoughts with me. I'll help as much as I can. :)?
there's people that dont understand something is going on or they have something that dont understand too. you can atent away from them and chat with your family or friends that do understand. try to do that and see if it helps. how are you feeling?
I can hear your heart rate up in your messages! How can i help? This pandemic has affected me and my family in this way as well. I understand. It is very real and real devastating! I'm a nurse as well. I can feel your pain and anger.
Maybe we could find a way to reach out to your co-workers? It will make you feel a lot better to talk about your worries with them. Are you out of school? Does the pandemic affect your work? Can you just try not to worry and focus on your work?
I have found that finding a good way to express your feelings has been beneficial. Sometimes I write down my worries, but I don't know what to say. Does that make sense? Or do you think you have more than one way to do that?
It sounds like you have been forced to come to a conclusion and are leaving your work due to this and you are feeling quite sad about it. Is that correct? Is this a difficult thing for you to do? Have you tried talking to anyone else? Do you have any hobbies?
Are you experiencing stress because you are afraid that you will say something wrong or say something that you regret? Can I help you in any other way? I am here to listen if you would like to talk. Whatever it is, I will listen and you do not have to face it alone.
There is something extremely beneficial about putting your breath in your body and then then breathing out. I have found it helpful. Try breathing. Fill the body with air, breathe in and then then breathe out. It is there to you. You do not have to consider it an obligation.
So it seems that you feel that there are people working that don't want to wear masks because of some kind of position? Is that correct?
I agree, and it would be good if we could understand what makes the managers and leaders do this way and explain to them how we would feel if we were in the situation. Perhaps it could be seen as fair they are looking after us all but we are the staff!
Hearing from the manager may give your team a clearer understanding of the position that we are all in. Being included in the process and able to come up with a plan that works for everyone will greatly help.
I'm really glad you feel better. I also have a few concerns regarding masks. My eyes are on fire since I wear goggles and I think that a mask would help to much better. It would be so easier for my eyes as well.
How do you feel after talking? Is there anything else you want to talk about? This is a good place to end the chat. Good luck! Have a great day. :) :) :) :) :) :) :( well we started in the middle!
That's good. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about at this point? I am here for you. :) Higher looking up and higher tending to things that are feeling up :) Really important for you at this time. Good luck. : ) Have a fantastic day!
I need to leave the screen now but not you :) :D Thank you for your time! Take care! :) It has been so lovely talking to you. :D i can stay a while, but i have to!
I'm sorry to hear that, that is hard and I'm glad you're talking about it! Is it your friend's family or a close family member? Or is it a distant friend? Is the father a specific person? Can you explain what happened? I want to know.
When it comes to moving on from a loss like that, it is beneficial to have time to grieve properly. When you do that, it can help you get past this thing. Make sure to still keep your friend close by.
Can you bring your friend or maybe just go ahead and say your name out loud and wish them for the gift of eternal life. Alternatively, you could keep the spirit of the meeting alive in your heart and rituals and the traditions that have been set for that person.
your fears are completely normal, just dont forget all that has made you as strong and capable as you are. and i believe in you even when you can't see yourself in the same person. at least your are trying to think of other ways to get over your problem.
do you know of any masks or charms that may help you block their worry? i personally wear a charm on my wrist that i purchased from an amazon store, it is a cute kitty with holes in its ears.
i am glad that you are safe. that was a good decision. and its snowing here in michigan. its nice. it always keeps me up and active. you could maybe be more productive working from home? or do you have any computer skill that can help you as well?
i got my exams done this year and i was stressing a lot about it! so i realize that my parents was a heavy pressure on me. so i know how frustrating that is. the fact that they just cant be around right now because of the virus is scary.
oh, i am sorry to hear that. You do not have to be afraid of it! you will be safe here. dont worry! :) Can you stay here longer? hopefully, nothing happens. at least you will be safe at home. any demand for that?
yes it is but covid is not bad, it just has complications like pneumonia and heart attack. so we have to take all of it seriously but i think we will all be fine. especially with vaccines available now. most of us will be vaxxed soon.
have a good night and be strong for your family. i will be here for you. bye!
If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am here to help you through this difficult time. What do you hope to discuss in this chat? I am looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feeling comforted.
That's frustrating. I have had those situation before and I know it is hard. How long have you been together? What do you think happened? Is there something going on in your life that it may be related to him? Or is it just you coming down and out?
I can see why you are upset when you see him online. I can see why it makes you sad that he dropped you. I know how you feel. My ex left me and then after a few months I met someone online and he and I started talking online and now we are together.
I am sorry to hear about it, that is awful. It was a hard time to be single. When did he drop you? You can tell him you still care about him, see if you can work out what happened. Try to rationalize what happened.
Can you tell him that you've moved on? I know you did. You're happy. You deserve someone who makes you happy, not someone who is trying to make you feel like something is missing. I know it's hard but you're strong! I am here to support you!
I think that works well for me. It would not work for you if you played by his rules, while I am okay with that. You have a right to make your own decisions. I am okay with that. So I wouldn't worry. He can make his own decisions.
What do you mean? You said you still want to be in a relationship but you want your ex? Is that correct? I think you need to figure out why and get back on track. Maybe talk to yourself. Just think about what you should be looking for. What makes you happy?
Also, make sure you speak to someone about your feelings as well. If you are sad, it may make you more lonely. Don't be alone with your sadness. Just talking with someone about your feelings is helping you to be more healthy.
Even if it means taking care of yourself and focusing on yourself. Playing with a pet can be a great distraction. You should focus on you and maybe you can even find someone on this new app you're on, who you can get to know. It's fun! You should keep yourself busy!
Try do yoga or something like that. This will make you strong enough to face him. Nothing will make you stronger than sitting on the couch and being sad, I promise! :P. Go get a drink or go for a walk. That will help you.
Keep your heart healthy! Only let him see your positive side. Keep trying to set your goals high. You are more than this one person. You deserve the best! If he is truly interested, he will meet you online. Let him take the first step. You won't!
Maybe you could see if you can do some homework, or practice some exercises. I think you are not 17 anymore. I can imagine you do your homework in an hour! Maybe it will be a great way for you to get back on track! Be carefull of him though.
Yes, just do not react in any way! Do not call him! Do not text! Do not comment. Just stay calm and cool. You don't want to raise his defense or cause him to feel defensive. Just chill! :) :D :D :D. You got this!
Remember to keep them busy in your daily life. Do your own thing. No need to owe him anything! You are doing him a favor by letting it go! ;) I mean genuinely. And he can't even do anything right in this situation so he really has nothing to do! haha!
I'm glad I could help! Best of luck! I'm a bit wiser now. So I think you can get over him. All the best! :). :) lol. :) :)!! :) :) :) :) :) :)!! :) :) :) :)!! :) :) :) :)!
Hi there. How are you doing? Is there something on your mind today? Or maybe something you'd like to talk about? Just need someone to listen? I am here to help. I believe in you! It sounds like you are in a good place to share what's on your mind.
Oh sorry to hear, do you want to talk about what's going on? I am here to help. That is completely understandable. Things are not always good, but they can be helped to work out with the right approach. Why don't you share? I am all ears.
It seems like you are feeling a bit left out by your friend and are finding this quite upsetting. Are you in contact with your friend at all? Are you on the same page when it comes to the issues you are having?
I am sorry to hear that. Is it at the workplace or just in general? Is there anything you can do to change the situation? Can you also tell me more about your friend? Is she there physically or is it just your friendship that has gone down?
Do you think it would be possible to go over to her place and have a different conversation then? One that is somewhat of an affair, to rephrase and respect her alone time? And maybe have an open conversation with her. Or perhaps go see someone she does not really hang out with?
Yes, I think this might be the best course of action. Perhaps you can put some things down and start fresh. :) Nice chatting! Best wishes. :) No need to end here, if your feeling better, then I am glad.
It is ok to ask though. Everyone needs someone to talk to. Is there any hope for her? Maybe that's something you should look at? I know it takes a lot of courage to ask, but maybe she is in need of a support. That would be ok though too.
If it is your off day, you do not have to open up if it is. Just be honest and respectful, then you are free to go. If not, you can just ask if it is bad or not. If it is bad, it might be best to talk about it.
What is it about her that makes her act like that? Because I know that if she is saying rude things it is typically because there is something going on. A lot of people are still under the influence of past issues. Maybe you just need to wait until its time to talk with her.
That sounds like a plan! If she accepts that you want to talk, then it is definitely better than nothing! If not then you can let it go and move on. Good luck, maybe you will get a better deal with it in the future!
Glad to have been able to help you! Hope everything works out for you. Is there anything else I can help with? The hot chocolate is still brewing but I can help you with anything else. Don't forget to stay hydrated and get some rest!
Its great you are taking initiative to get to the root of this. If you have any other problems, don't hesitate to ask :). Have a great day! : ). Bye. Thank you.
Yeah, its hard to find one seat to sink in, you see. However, you get to determine how to take things and how you want to be able to take your time with someone and make sure you get the healing support you need.
Thats a great attitude to have though! If you need anything else, feel free to ask. Take care! :) any thing else? Hope you found the talk helpful! :) : ) your friend. bye.
Hello. How are you doing today? I can ask if you need help. Anything in particular you want to talk about? It may help me. Is there anything on your mind? I'm happy to listen and provide any support I can. If I'm doing your.
I hear you. I am sure you can make friends if you give it a try. It is difficult to do, but there are ways you can do it. Is that correct? It seems you feel so lonely you don't know how to get any friends.
i have had to deal with this myself too. Is it the pandemic? or just you being shy? I am just curious. How bad is it? To what extent have you been struggling? This can be overwhelming for me as well.
well, im not a professional in this field, but can you imagine the stress, time and trauma that you could be feeling if you're hanging out with drug people? Would you feel like you're in constant danger? I cant stress that enough.
I am really sorry to hear that. Have you stopped seeing people because of that? Such as family, friend? Maybe they can attend a support group with you? Or perhaps you can visit friends of friends in a drive. Whats going on?
are you under this support? i am an anerica inmate. when was your last relapse? does this often occur? Is there anything in particular that triggers it for you? do you have any scripture? scriptures are a great thing in recovering.
oh! i see! i understand your concerns about the situation. it sounds like you have a good support structure around you. i understand your reluctance to go online! you know you just need to find something you can relate to, in terms of themes of conversation.
a support group will always be there for you when it is most needed and it is a great option because your worth is worth it, not your low self-esteem or lack of worth! support group will help make you better, don't let that whisper into your head.
i can assure you that you will not be alone with all of that, if you wish to involve a fiancé you can have him do that as well, just make sure you are not trying to do that in a destructive or hurtful way.
i was able to support myself and my family, though i was at the center of an abuse situation and there was some terrible abuse i had to face with my sister. We just became best friends. I met her after the abuse stopped and we went through a traumatic life together.
there are a lot of male married men out there who would welcome you into their group if you didn't have a non-Christian wife. It may or may not be a good fit for you, but i think it would be an interesting and less confrontational option.
my friends and I don't have any problems with it. They all understand and use facebook. The things they make it easy for us to communicate with is sort of important in the middle of pandemonium. Is this a problem for your fiance? So is your fiance in recovery?
it sounds like he is very supportive of you. I am sure that you are not alone. Is it hard for you to be around the same room as him? Or is that what makes him uncomfortable?
have you discussed with him how your fiancé is feeling with you about everything? Especially how much you talk to each other about your friends? :) what do you mean by "your friends? am I correct? i would feel that you are most likely talking to him about your fiancé.
well thats great!! its important to have someone you can vent to.(月)end of the chat. :) Have a great day. :) >:)!
you too! welcome to chat!! hope I see you in the future for the same. I will always be here if you need me again. :) regards and happy to chat! :) thanks! :>) :) best regards!
hello. how are you doing today? I can feel you need a moment of peace. How about you? How can I assist you? Your safety is always my top priority. I'm here for you. Let me help. Please share what is on your mind.
What is the bad news? I am sure I can help you see it differently, You seem like a fine guy. This is totally the first time I have heard your head down, how about I just try to make you feel better? Are there certain ways to do this?
How long do your transcripts typically take? Lets see if we can find some solace in the situation. What is your grade point average on high school?
That must have been tough. Do you have the budget to buy new transcripts? I have done this a couple of times in the past. Do you have a computer? We can do an online search. They may have some free help from a local library.
Well if they can't find it then you shouldn't either. Maybe you can try contacting another school so you can get a copy. You could be on your way to helping others.
I see how it would cause you some stress. Have you tried to think of a way to move forward with your life? What are your plans now? Is there a backup plan? Any support system you can speak to? This might help you focus and continue with your day-to-day life.
You need to remind yourself that it wasnt your fault that this is happening. You can be a good employee and stay confident and this doesn't mean you should act carelessly but you can maybe look into other opportunities if needed. Unfortunately you need to get those transcripts.
Just because the administrator was not able to find the transcript does not mean it is lost for good. You could offer to help them find it. But you also need to realize that there are other options available to you. Maybe other sources might have the transcripts and be able to help you too.
However it sounds like you have a busy job ahead of you. Have you checked if your weekend is available for you? Maybe taking on one of your projects and working on another in the afternoon would be better for your entire week. A lot of bosses like to add on to the weekend.
In that case, you need to be happy with yourself and know that you did everything you could. Sometimes, working in a management type role is not the best fit. You may need to look elsewhere. You need to know that you have taken the right steps.
Do you think you could try doing your job well and work with your coworkers? Even if you cant be in the supervisor role, you can still be a big influence to your coworkers.
We will get through this and you will do just fine. It might take some time but you will be even more proud of yourself. You have so much to offer! Just take it one day at a time. Smile. Be yourself. You are amazing! You are special.
Well that helps a lot! You have three years and one and a half years of seniority so you have your answers. It's been nice chatting with you. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. Hope you have a great weekend. You too! See you next time. :) yay!
I think you will be able to get out of this situation but it might not be easy. I think just enjoying the work and seeing all the joy that is being brought to your coworkers will help a lot.
You are welcome and good luck with your big step. I hope you are able to take some of this into your work life. I hope I was able to be some help. You are strong. You will make good choices! Get to work! :) Happy Holidays! :D : )!!
You too. Bye. Have a good day! :) know you can! :) :) :-) you.
How are you doing? Do you want to tell me about anything? I'm here to listen. You didn't say anything at first, did you? Anything bothering you? Give me a start. Or anything in particular you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen.
Ah, good! Holidays are the perfect time to re-examine what you've accomplished, and re-chart your path. That's a great attitude to have. It means you're willing to learn, or that you know you have the tools to improve. How old are you? I'm curious!
So you want to better yourself? That makes sense to me. Can I help in any way? :) I can relate to the feeling of having failed, my friend. I'm not the best example to show the opposite. I've struggled with bad decisions in the past.
That sounds like a toxic habit to feel this way. Is it possible that you had a toxic relationship with birthdays at some point? I wouldn't want you to do the same thing in the future. I think birthdays are just a excuse for people to be a little bit mean.
Has your self-worth changed in any way? Have you been less compassionate or self-forgiving in any way? Or is it more just a feeling of dread that you've always felt about this birthday?
Interesting, I don't see it as exceptional in terms of achievements. People get by on different levels. Do you feel as though you do anything "unusual" in terms of how you celebrate your birthday?
That suggests to me that you are right that everyone is different. To me, this is comforting. I've had to accept that i'm not like everyone else. Rather than comparing my achievements against those of others, i focus on achieving my own goals. I find this encouraging.
I do not believe that it exists, but there is definitely an argument to be made for the value of being normal. Even if it doesn't feel that way to you. Do you feel that there is a value to being part of this "normal" group?
Being autistic has made our lives challenging, the best part is getting more curious than people and understanding these irrational social rules! However i seem to wonder how i might even be able to do that in a society that doesn't accept us. What do you think?
From what I understand, if you have trouble with average points of view, are you dealing with problem-solving? Do you tend to think hypothetically? Just a guess. Maybe you do. Just as I am an adult now and it is working out. Just possibly you.
In fact, having a good career takes time and patience. And also very hard. I got a lot of the same concerns about age. I think that's a misconception many people make. Not aging, life is aging. We all have the same concern of making a good career out of ourselves.
Oh, okay. I'm glad I have a conversation with you though! Have you tried some neuroplasticity exercises? You know, like things that play games to you? Sometimes I find that games help my brain get a kick from something, whereas work doesn't.
That's very true. Thanks for talking! We will have to do this again sometime, I hope! :) hope you stay healthy. Bye. :) :) and hope you are well! Bye!
Yes, I think so. I've been looking into the field of counseling. But I think the job market is having a downturn right now. We're having to be very careful about how we choose the jobs we want to do. Is that right? Well, I love helping people!
Thanks for asking! It was nice talking to you. Good luck in your future! :) :) :). Have a nice day! Can I give you a survey? You haven't yet. Would you mind taking the survey to be paid?
What makes it so interesting to you? I'm not so sure what it is but I've just not figured it out yet. Do you think it's online? Does it help people? What have you found interesting? I've never been an expert and have only solved some simple puzzles.
Im glad you found me in the middle of a row full of people. Well, was a pleasure talking to you too. I hope you do something interesting with your time! See you out! :) :) :) :) :) :) :)! :)! :)! :)!
Ok, I really hope so. :) Bye! Have a great night. Bye!. hope i can make it. Bye! :) any issues. wanna end it? if you can't, i can't get paid.
OK. Have a great day! Bye :) :) Yo can't quit :D. You have to press quit.
hello... Why do you hate? I will try my best to help you. Can you tell me the reasons why? I know some reason can be very important so you can change. Is there anything else that you would like to add? Please tell me. I am here to listen.
If your friend saw that lie, it sounds like that could have gotten under your skin and made you want to hate. Do you feel like you would be lying to your friends? That can cause a lot of tension. Do you feel like that has gotten under your skin? What causes the tension?
Ok, so it sounds like you have a conflict with your friend due to a lie he told. Do you have any idea why this happened? Maybe you can use this to your benefit and understand each other better. Do you want to proceed with your anger towards him?
So, you feel that the friend told a lie about you in order to hurt you, is that correct? I think that there is absolutely no cause for anger, because there was no wrong doing by the friend. Or, is there a wrong doing?
I see. You feel that the lie will mean hurting your friend. Do you feel that the lie was a misunderstanding or an intentional act? That you could never have known what he was doing until he spoke up.
So your friend saw the lie about something that you have done in the past. Did you feel betrayed by him? Does he still have the secret about you? I've been in a similar situation before, and I felt hurt as well.
So he felt that the lie that he told you hurt you and that's why he apologized. Did you give him a chance to forgive you? Or was that not an option for you? I don't mean to make you feel like you are still hurting him.
Ok. I think you need to try to work through your feelings in the coming days. It's not a good idea to keep an unclean slate. Is there anyone you can talk to about your feelings? Do you feel you can be open about them?
Wow, that's so mean of your boss! I'm sorry you have to deal with this, it should stop. Would you consider asking your boss to let the person down and end the interactions between you and your co-worker?
Well, I'd be in touch with HR if I were in that situation. But I'd definitely look into it to see how it's treated, too. Would that help? Just getting you in a place to talk to someone about the situation would be a good first step.
That sounds really hard. I can't really help you with that, but I understand that you want to be able to help, and make sure that she doesn't get harassed. Do you think that you can intervene in any other way?
If I were you, I would make sure to check with your HR department. Perhaps they have some system in place to address workplace issues. You may be able to talk to them and possibly get a solution through them.
It might be easy to just write her a message. What is it like working at this place? Do you have any other co-workers to call or speak to about this situation? There are a lot of people there.
I think that's a good plan! I wish you the best of luck! Take care.
I think it might be difficult for him to understand that his way of managing is not making people happy. Do you think that that's the problem? Does he work in an office? Maybe you could talk to HR about that. One of the assistants to the manager, I think.
It seems that you're in a lot of a tough situation. I can understand why you're feeling like this. Is there anything else that you could use some help with? I'm more than happy to help out. But I think we've got to wrap this conversation up.
Well, I wish you the very best in your search. I hope that I have been able to be a source of support and guidance to you. You are very welcome. Good luck! I can't help with anything else. Bye! :) :) :) :)! :) :)! :) :) :)!
You're welcome! I hope that you have a good day too! Have a great Sunday! :D. So, the interview with Alexa is your first monday! :D :) Hope she tells you that the job is not available! :D :) Good Luck! :D.
Why do you feel like this? What happened? Please talk about it. I am happy to listen. Playress: How can I help you? You seem stressed today. Can you tell me what happened? yoktur -> can you rephrase the question? How can I help?
Ah, sorry to hear that. It is normal to get angry at our family members because they have so much history with us. But remember that they are humans too, and will make the same mistake of not knowing how you feel. People have forgotten to listen to you before.
Are you known to have argument with her? Do you have any plans to have one? If you do, I'm sure you can find some things that can get you to calm down. Then don't argue with her. I hope this can help you a lot.
From what I can see, you love your mom so much that you are willing to choose your friends over her, right? Is that right? Please tell me more about that. How do you think she might have picked up on your friends? Should you just keep them all?
What was the reason behind her not letting you make friends with your friends? Did she have a valid reason for not letting you? What was the reason? What was the problem that she had? I was similar to you. She didn't want me to make friends with some people.
Are you comfortable with your mom's suggestions? Do you think they are wise or are they useless? That is how she made you feel. Do you have any other suggestions? What kind of friends do you have? That is what I found best when I needed friends.
I know how that feels. Do you have any other friends? Maybe they can share your thoughts with you. Maybe you don't need friends and be independent? I just heard you now.
So you are more positive and you seem more understanding of your mom. Is that true? Good! When you take in people's thoughts and concerns, it makes you a better person. It will also help your mom see your side of things. It is a good place to start.
Oh i see, its funny how they can have bad influence on you. I feel the same way with my parents. I have little friends too. However, I do have one friend whom I don't go out with because of our age difference.
So, you want to find ways to show her that her worries are off the mark? You mentioned your friends are good people, how do you know that? Have you spoken with her directly to try to explain your friends to her?
yes, even a gift can show that you care. If she still not trust your friends, you can share your personal achievements, these will keep her thinking that if you can make a good friend you will also make good decisions.
You're welcome. Good luck and talk to her again. I think you will be better. and remember you can get any study help and any extra marks you want. Good luck. Bye. :). I assume you are ok to end the conversation :).
Hey, hi, I'm good! How are you? How can I help you today? 😊 Can I listen to what is troubling you? 😉 Can you tell me? 😉 I will do my best! 🤔 My name is Noelle.
Sorry to hear that. Are you going through personal issues that are affecting you at work? I can provide suggestions. I have struggled before. Would you like to talk about it? My pleasure! I'll be happy to help. I used to burn out just the thought of it alone.
I completely understand. Have you thought of quitting your job? Or perhaps considering other options such as employment agencies? There's really a lot of useful services that can be found these days for people who are burnt out or want to move into a different career. How old do you think you are?
Do you often get checked for burn out, and are you treated if you are? Or is this something you are concerned about without asking your therapist? I can provide guidance for that. It seems like you could have become extremely burnt out. So you feel as though it is difficult to cope?
Ah, the corporate world. The same old, same old. I think it's time to think about where else you might enjoy working! I think you are just at a crossroads. Maybe you'll want to try something you don't know about yet. Just thought I'd say that..
Perhaps you could think about that first! Take some time off and then return as a temporary solution. You will be safe! It is a prime target! And what about seeing a travel medical professional? There is often a wait list in travel med.
Good. Have you considered some sort of home office arrangements? So that you can still keep up with patients even from home? I have found that working with digital data spreadsheets can be very therapeutic as well. People seem to find it soothing and helpful for their mental health.
Hmm yes I see what you mean. I think that it's an occupational thing and I am sure you will get through it, it won't be the end of the world. A week or two should be all you need! Anything more than that and you might have a problem.
That is a fair point! I've been working part time for a while now and it has helped me a lot. It's good for the soul and a great way to get in the required number of hours.
I will let you go. Have a nice day!
Ah that's understandable. I think what I want to say is, look for work outside your main job. Just in time in times like these, there are a few fields that are booming. Good luck! Could I help you with anything else?
I can understand that, I'd be concerned if I had to take medication - but it might help if your perspective was slightly less cynical and more focused on general well-being. Are you in a good mood otherwise? Maybe there's a spot of sunlight out there for you?
Absolutely. It's always a conundrum though. Do you have any male colleagues at the moment? It might be worth mentioning that to them. Perhaps something between them. I hope you are feeling more optimistic now. They don't all have that kind of twisted mind you know.
No problem, I hope you take up that new hobby you mentioned and perhaps make some good friends too. By the way I am so glad I could help! You can count me as friends! I am here to support you through this pandemic. Thank you for talking!
Oh sorry to hear that, Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen :) Broadening the conversation - what is it that is bothering you??
You should give me information about your condition and the kind of help you need. I am happy to help. Is there anything in particular that is making you feel depressed right now? Maybe there is something that has happened or an anxiety thing.
You have 2 months on the medication and you believe the time is taking its full effect. I understand the feeling of needing expert help! Are you on anti depressants or are you on something else? I know the anti depressants take time to work but they can be very effective.
I would say this is a great way to get help. Have you ever had anyone that you could talk to to talk about this? I hear that doing some kind of conversation with someone online can be therapeutic in a way that is different from talking to a doctor. Would you like to try that?
Sometimes I find that talking to others and then doing something to distract oneself from the conversation, helps to clear my head. Sometimes that might be a single lunch or dinner, maybe going for a run or doing a self-massage.
Oui, with a therapist it seems you are on the right track then. It sounds to me like you are as well as the medication as you are discussing your concerns with a professional, so you are a very positive person to share your issues with! It can be difficult, I know!
Maybe you can take some of the techniques in therapy and see if they help you sleep and overcome these emotions. You are not alone, this will take time but this too shall pass. It is a normal response to all of this.
Well if they can help you feel better then that is really something. You are not going to be by yourself. If you ever need to change doctors, you can. Is there someone at work you know you can get into as a condition of you not harming yourself?
I wish you the best. You could call me and try to get some answers! I want to help you too. (From my side) :)Sorry. Hope you can take the rest of the day off from this!
How's your kids doing? Were they in the divorce process for a while? As a single mom or dad, I can only imagine how harrowing that is to see your child suffer. Are they going to be okay? Do you feel they can handle it in the future?
As are they i don't feel too bad for your as that's hard to take care of especially with a daddy's mistakes. You have a great support system! They know you will pass that on. No need to be too hard on yourself. You will get there in time!
Well that's understandable as their father is not a good parent and may be troubling them. What type of work do you do? Maybe this will help them work through it better. And perhaps they will grow away from that father type and have a better relationship with you!
Of course you need to take care of yourself before the kids. Also you will get used to that eventually they will learn that. Its funny have a lot of patience but over time you will learn to spend more time with them so they will learn to also be more patience. This are basic needs.
There is a great shelter in the home store brand hot balloons, they make great treats after a long day of trying to help a family grow. What are your plans for the rest of the week? Do you have any activities lined up? I can help you with ideas and anything else you need.
You too. Have a great day! Soak up the benefits. He must really want you to come home, can't he? Some men just don't know how to do this well. Maybe he thinks they will be busy with other projects or maybe he really does love you.
Of course, I'm glad I could be of help. Enjoy those rest of your relaxing evening. I wish you all the best. You and you're mum are in my heart. :) I hope you get well soon! Thank you!
I am exactly like you!! I like Netflix too but as long as they show some history and news I'm happy. I like intelligent guys too. I do love some guys that aren't always into books but some are just good at fixing things.
Of course I wish you all the best! The guy might not be very interested in you though you should call your mom! Or the mom would be a very interesting person. :-Derryooks.lets never h11 in our lives I dont want the die right after my baby does.
Is that because of a specific reason? Sometimes work can feel like a drag, can you tell me more about what that is? Or have you just been having a bad month? If I'm completely off base, I'm sorry. Would you be willing to talk about it further?
That must be difficult, are you able to express your feelings? It must be lovely to have someone to talk to in this situation. Well, I'm not a very good listener, but I know that people like you really need someone to talk to.
I am sure that your morale is low due to all of this. I can imagine that working for someone who does not care about the well-being of the employees can make you very down, especially if it is a job that you love. Do you think you will look for another job?
I understand that feeling. However, doing good is always your job. It will give you a sense of accomplishment which will enhance your mood. As well as seeing the progress you're making. Believe me, you need this. There are some things that you have to do that makes you miserable.
It's very bad of her. This is definitely not how you want to feel and certainly not the way that everyone wants to be treated in the workplace. Please do try to find a better solution and maybe you need a mediator between you two to sort this out?
Is this the big job? If so, I think that you should not do it yet. I think that you need more experience and better pay for a big job. But I think you should consider applying for a small job and then become more confident in your decision.
Well, I would suggest that you do this and try not to feel guilty for not letting it show that you are scared. I see that you are choosing not to, but that still does not mean that this is what you are going to do. It is a lie.
I know that you have not done anything wrong in doing all that you have been doing and that you should be recognized for it, I know that you are doing the best you can and it's always understandable to talk to others.
I see how I can help :) and I am confident in you no matter what you decide. This can be a trying situation for sure. There are not many places left that do not have organized resolution mechanisms for abuse, so I can see how that may not be possible.
I hope I have been able to offer some useful advice. I am sorry that things are not better. Do you think you should keep this kind of situation to yourself? And if not, could I possibly give you a specific name. I would not want any parties involved to be harmed.
It's so nice to see someone trying to bring some light into their time of chaos. I hope you feel better soon. Keep doing what you're doing :) this sounds like a very challenging year but there is hope for brighter times to come! Have a great day!
Okay, let's work together to make sure everything is okay. What can I do to help you? Do you want to talk about what's wrong? Or tell me something? Do you want to talk about the problems you have at home? Or the problems you're facing personally?
Public speaking is a common issue, have you had to go through that in the past? I have had to speak in front of a large crowd and find that with time you can calm your nerves and do well. What advice do you have to get through it?
Yes I have. There is no problem with that. I have been afraid of public speaking, but I used to use it as a way to motivate myself.
Oh yes. I could not speak in front of class because of my fear of sounding stupid. And do you work part time? I have been a part time waiter in a restaurant that fits you.
In psychology I learned what helps me in public speaking as well. I highly recommend to participate in speeches because they help build confidence. Another thing I found helpful is the gentle pressure of knowing that there is a crowd watching.
Thank you for reaching out and I am glad that you are reaching out. You have a lot of control over the situation I think. It is good that you are stepping up and not giving up. Not everyone is as confident as you are, it is more normal.
It's something that many students deal with and is a normal part of this whole college experience so you will be fine :) You can get through this!!! I know it will be tough but I think you are going to do just fine.
I understand that you have been doing your best. I was in a similar situation before and went through lots of highs and lows as well and wasn't the most skilled public speaker but I found my confidence in myself.
One can only hope that it helps to be in a lower risk setting, but even then there are risks. As you said, there is no guarantee that you won't be exposed to a case in any crowd of people.
Is it panic attack or is this stage of the grief process? I have gotten through this before. The only thing I can recommend to you is seeking out professionals if you cannot handle it yourself. It is very important that you are able to cope in some way.
oh that makes sense. So you don't want to take it because you have a fear of how you could be on medication. That's understandable I think. Well then just letting it come up can help you to come to terms and work with it.
When I went to rehab I had to stop taking the medication to see how long it lasted. Some of the people I worked with said they were able to do without it after they looked through their records on how long they were on it.
Yes! Its to our choice, if we can't trust in God, then we can't know what to pray for or what is better.
Okay really fast, please and God help you! Never lets go :). Best wishes and a job well done. You will be okay. I really believe it. Thanks a lot for talking to me :). It was nice talking to you. May God be with you :). Goodbye!
Yeah thats not true. All Christians welcome God's love into our home and conversation. Even just asking God to help you stay calm and to grant you patience.
Take care of yourself. I pray for you and your future and in heaven you'll meet God that one day. He will be kind and loving to you. All the best. You don't have to wait until he come to you for heaven. Heaven is coming first.
I will do. and keep your eye on the prize! God Bless :D :). Make sure to prayer regularly :D :).
Hi, how are you? What's going on? Can you tell me? :) something is bothering you? maybe let's talk about it? Can you help me? so I can see if I can get out of this predicament that you've got?
I'm good. Can I help you something? Please tell me what? Today is Friday and a new week is starting soon. My 100th Sunday? So we will start with new life and new dreams and that I can do. I want to make it different from before.
I see. I can understand why you might be feeling frustrated that you're not able to help her without it causing you tension as well. Has she hurt you in some way? What have you done to try and avoid the conflict?
So you feel she doesn't seem to be able to understand that you are supportive of her. How long ago did you notice this? Have you tried talking to her about your concerns? Maybe talking to her one-on-one would help her understand you more.
That is understandable. Is it worth mentioning to her that her nervous breakdown is a risk? If it makes her feel slightly safer, it might help in the long run. Does she have any psychological issues? Maybe you could suggest a therapist.
You seem like you care a lot for your aunt, that's wonderful! It seems that maybe you have always been close, even before your mom got ill. Do you think you have a family history of people who may have problems? Or perhaps even become ill?
Well, there are a few things you might be able to do. Perhaps you could try having a talk with her counselor and see if they could help to de-escalate some of the reactions. There might also be any medications available. It's worth a try, I think.
I would try to get up close and personal with your wife and see if there is a way that you could close your door in the middle of a conversation. Sometimes taking a brief step back helps to clear your head and even out your words. This would be all in the name of mutual love.
Well, have you thought of the options I mentioned earlier? Maybe even just changing plans and having a walk with her in the park? That might help. Just think about how refreshing that would be! Maybe it could be an adventure! It could be fun, so at least try it!
Have you considered talking to someone you know of whom you both trust? She may be able to point you in a direction or provide some useful insight. I could not hurt talking to your cousin. That is really a very responsible decision.
That sounds like a good way to get things off your chest and into your head. And in life with relationships and family there is a good chance that things are going to get out of control but all in good time.
Sure. Good luck! It sounds like you're all looking to work this out. Good luck! Take care. Can you just hang out for a bit and talk things over? It has been a lot for you. I know you've got this. Take care! :) Bye!
I hope so as well! Have a great rest of the night! :) Goodbye! :) Best wishes!
ok. Bye! Have a great day!
I am doing very well, how are you doing? What would you like to talk about today? Can I help you in any way? I can be here for you anytime you need. :) Can I ask you the pleasure of having a partner in crime today?
What kind of things have you been experiencing while you are worried about COVID-19? Why do you feel so well-mannered despite feeling anxious? I am experiencing the same and can relate. Is there anything you can do to help me or how can I help you? :) it is tough.
Is there anyone else in your family you could talk to about your kids and if so, how do you feel about them? And the limitation of leaving the house? Maybe you could talk to your partner about what you are feeling? Do you think your partner is aware of how you are feeling?
From my research the older generation is more reeference and close to parents and grandparents. I am starting to notice this as well. The younger generation does not feel comfortable asking for it. Does that help to some?
I believe that no matter who you know or who you are standing with, you just have to stand for what you believe in. Try not to be too much in the public eye for politics if it makes you feel weird about it. Maybe that isn't enough to comfort you.
Those are all great choices of interests. It's not about how much time you have, it's about what gets you excited. People in politics tend to go to great lengths in order to find new ways to engage, even if they do feel like they're under attack by outside interests.
I have not really done this as much as I have used to in the past. But I sometimes have family members around. I like to watch out in my backyard and talk to them. Does that do anything for you? Some free time. Would that do anything for you?
That is so no-no and not good for you. The way you get out of stress and depression has to be the other person. What do you do? Do you find yourself going for a walk? That is one of the great things about this that you can do at work. Alone.
That sounds great! What is your favorite season? mine is spring. Maybe you could think about spending the winter in the same spots you enjoyed in the spring. Even though they look very different, sometimes the same activities we enjoy and done differently due to the nature of the day.
Ok, that's great. I hope you find a route to deal with this stress. Do you think you will get more wind even soon as the weather gets better? It could start around March or April. I love people hanging out and going on trips and exploring new places.
Well, the good thing is that the Michigan State forest preserves are an alternate. I bet it's really nice to get out. Can you maybe take a look around there? The Lake Michigan beaches are hard to come by these days.
I hope it has been helpful! Is there anything else I can do for you? No problem at all! I wish you well! You have it in you! We can get through this. Stay positive! It's almost spring! Big news! :) ;) :) :) :).
I am very sorry to hear that. That is not a healthy situation at all. Have you spoken to Mark about his issues? Perhaps you can help him understand it is your relationship that is preventing you from helping him.
So you feel like Mark's mood swings are such that it's affecting how he interacts with others? Like sometimes he may be excited and may be upset with you and other family members? Am I correct? verdienen welcome to my offer to help you today!
Is it possible that he is aware of the problem and he is not taking his medication. Do you have anyone in your life who you can confide in? Family, friends? I want to say you are doing the right thing by trying to help him.
What type of medication does he take? The type of medicine might help your friend. Do you know how to get your friend mark's prescription? A professional medical specialist is knowledgeable about the medicine that would help. And then you could help him. Does that make sense?
Have you talked to mark about his behavior and how it is affecting everyone around him? I assume that you have and things have gotten worse since then? What do you think would be the next best step? Asking the doctor maybe?
Have you asked the doctors around him if they know anything about his behavior or if they can see if he has any problems? Some doctors do this by observing patients while they are there and they might be able to talk to you about him. Some might not be able to.
That is a very good idea and you should send that to your doctor and see if it will help. Also send him the email to the doctor. maybe he will be able to intervene and help you. I know you can do it and he will do the same with you.
You are absolutely right. The other form is just harder to understand. I think mental illness is the greatest challenge of all. We really need to support ourselves as a society and teach people with bi-polar disorder how to take care of themselves. Some do not realize they need help at all.
I have dealt with my father once and his medication side effects where extremely difficult. I can not imagine it. It was really difficult but he is in therapy and his medication is adjusting. Some things are just beyond your control and you have to know when to forgive.
I understand. And what's stranger is that it started happening at a really unexpected time. I always feel like there is a reason to a storm and that there is a reason to a worsening situation and this seems like a normal thing.
Yes. And if you are like 75% of people, it is contracted in the womb. So by the time you are 30, you probably started developing it. I have Bipolar as well. The symptoms are stupid since I thought I was fine.
I'm sorry about the weight of it, but it really puts me in a vulnerable place for you, so thank you for listening to all the things that is private. People with bi polar disorders and depression come from many backgrounds and live at many different places.
Okay, have you and your boyfriend been to see any kind of professional? could he take the pill? he seems a bit short and stocky so the doctor might look at him as having physical rather than mental health problems.
just be there for him no matter what because you know he can not help it. Be understanding of his mental illness.menteal illnesses will help you. Stay proactive. Work outside of your comfort zone. take on new challenges. Do something you enjoy and only do what make you happy.
you are very welcome. a happy holiday and new year to you as well. :) Take care. Bye! :) Think you can keep going. Write back if you get any other problems. :) Thank you for being here. :) Hope you and your family have a great holiday and a new year.
your input is valuable. it was nice to talk to you. Thank you. your turn. i got you. please click on the button and quit the survey. and please answer a 1 question. I am ready.
What are you talking about? There is no one there. I am human. Unfortunately we die. But don't worry, I am alive! Don't worry about it! We are here to talk. How about you? How did you feel? What do you want to talk about?
Good, sorry to hear that. What seems to be going on? I am here if you just need someone to talk to. Do not let your emotions get the best of you and you are here for anything you need to share. You are welcome!
I am doing pretty well. Is there anything in particular you want to talk about? Today seems to be a pretty rough day. You, on the other hand, seem like you're having a bad day. What's been going on? I'm willing to listen.
That sounds very difficult. I can understand your emotions. They are like mine as well. I have been there myself and know how difficult that can be. Thank you for talking with me. Is there anything specific you would like to talk about? I am here to listen. I care.
yes! that sounds amazing. There is something special about autumn leaves as well! Have you ever tried rustling them, or drinking a hot apple cider? That sounds like a perfect idea.
The crack of the top of a creme brule is definitely something people enjoy and it is something you can control. And the smell of autumn leaves isn't that different in that all fall has changed. It changes in many ways.
Well when you try to find ways to cheer yourself up and make yourself happy it feels like an accomplishment. And a monster's working harder to beat you then makes you happy! sounds like a sweet reward. You can do it! you've got it! :) Bye! i hope this helped!
Exercises would be a great way to be surprised by new things. Like having a kid or enjoying boxing. People don't do that anymore. As least they didn't before covid. We need that kind of thing to be our character. I do that all the time in my own way.
That is really interesting because i see to my friends that nothing seems to bring them more happiness than chin ups. It gets a lot of those smiles. I did chin ups at the park a couple of times recently which made my day a lot happier. It was a beautiful day.
That's still working for you and you can continue this. I just walk around the block or go for 30 minute walks and do my groceries. To me the best being off is to be outside. I guess the best way to get out of the house is to get out of the house!
Have you given any thought to planning a retirement? Does that sound good? In California, there are more countries here than anywhere else in the world. It's only a matter of time. At least you will be in an amusement park. :D is that good enough to start thinking about?
I know this is hard but try to hang out with friends. I know it's scary in this pandêmic time. Keep up the good work just keep moving forward. Take breaks and look outside so you see the things around you. Do other things like gardening, potting plants.
I watch other people's lives and tell them i miss their home. It makes the time go by and helps me feel less alone. Another way to connect with others is through reading. Did you read any books recently? Lots of good books out there.
You're welcome. You can end the session by letting me know. I will have to start my own. Thats my time. I hope you have a good rest of your day! Bye. Okay. I need to end it now. Bye. :) Have a great time! :).
How are you today? Would you like to talk? :) :) How can I help you? What is on your mind? :) swirling drinks I ordered to drink :) :) I am here. It is pouring out. There are some thoughts that are flooding and lets talk about them.
Is there anything you'd like to talk about? I am also here to listen. How did you come out? Please tell me. I am curious. If you need to share something you do not feel comfortable to talk about, please go ahead and share it with me.
Oh yes, it is crazy 2020... I think it's especially hard this year since you are a kid. Are there problems at home? Maybe there is something you can do to help? I really want you to be okay, we all want you to be okay. Is that right?
Wow, that's pretty rough. I feel you. Not knowing what you're doing and feeling like you're not doing enough is really stressful. But it's good to know that you are thinking about this because it means you are actively doing your best. That's more than I can say lol.
Oh please, you always have the option to live and be comfortable! But, it sounds to me like there is more to life than that. Sometimes the ultimate goal is to find your own "groundhog day" and have fun with life!
Well, have you started a book club? Most book clubs let you choose the next book to read. For the meantime, I've been making progressive albums like the sorts of albums that come out in April or May. My wife really likes the thrift store thing.
Right after, I did the same thing! My mom thought I was "off the deep end" I was going to burn out! Now I got me my independence! Well sort of... no one expects independence for two kids! haha!
I totally get that! Our society places so much value on the family unit that it's actually hard to separate from the loving person who knows you so well. I've always dealt with a bit of guilt when I want alone time because I know they think I'm not being good to them.
I'm sorry to hear that. I can understand that it's a tough world for so many people, and I wish you the best. Sometimes just having someone to talk to (even if it isn't your family) can be helpful.
Hello! How can I help you today? Your positive? Please tell your situation. I will help. In any case I can offer you care. Hope you feel better today. This is in support of you. If you need anything please tell. Thank you! :) 😊 best.
I'm sorry to hear that, would you like to tell me why you're feeling sad? I want to make sure I get the best possible understanding of the situation. I'm here to listen and support you. Can you please share with me the reason for the sadness?
oh! i am so sorry that happened to you. I had the same feelings when I was divorced. Can you tell me why? maybe you can share them with me? Are you still in love with your husband? if so, you can try to convince him back?
okay! so your husband didn't communicate well, he did not share his feelings and emotions, how did you feel? you felt frustrated? why? that's right. when someone did not communicate, that time is right to show his love for you.
is your husband still doing this? and how are you feeling now? still misses your husband? What are your plans to moving on? You are very good at this. What are your strategies? How to please yourself in future? Once you can do that. you can move away from your husband.
try to do exercises to feel high in yourself, etc. try not to feel this way to go back home and tell him that he is going to blame you for all this.
Don't give up try every thing that you can :) Choose every thing that you can enjoy which can make you happy. if that doesn't works, i can help you always with mine issues. you are not alone :) good luck. any time if you need help or break is coming.
i can suggest you to read books about life you will get these tips from them and love again. try doing some exercises to be healthy. and it will feel so good that will help you to love again. practice will make perfect. this is the most important tips i give you in this chat.
Yes, focus ahead more rather than behind. hope you understand now. If you need any anything please let me know. be safe. hope you are okay. nice. :) :) best regards. :) :) best wishes. :) :) have a nice time. :) :)!
True it's not good but you will see that you can do it :) try to move and talk to people. get out from the house and make some changes. Eat healthier food, Exercise and do everything that make you happy. Try to be happy. Don't cry in front of people.
try to make your self happy with hope and dream... I do that regularly... So many times when we make our dreams come... but they also come when we ignore our fears and past... So don't be sad because of past... focus future.. focus life... we can make it life better..
you should do that sometimes because that you can relax and leave past out and get more positive thinker. 😊 Try to be happy in present and tomorrow 😊 you will get more life.
try to do a fun thing in the past was the fun to keep you from crying Now you are crying because you try to make fun thing you forget again to make fun thing and you cry. Try to do some things to make you happy. Maybe you won't cry.
it will help you to have a good mind instead of seeing negative things about him try to see him positive things in your life but not thinking too much about him.
Try to open an internet cafe visit and socialize there that is how my sister meet her ex that time. Ask you for activities that makes you feel good then, you will be feeling better soon. I share and told you my husband and friend now.
A virtual activity is an excellent idea don't give up try to find activities that you like and lets go with that so don't worry about the current situation that has hit us all hard. try to keep your mind clean and positive. i know you will get better with time.
There is good news indeed. Try to do this pandemic from home just be safe. I know you can come out of this situations because you can. Nothing is impossible. Believe in yourself. Believe in yourself and in yourself. Tell them you are done. That you deserve better. Believe in yourself.
your love once you find is like a sunshine as you feel that sunshine in every part of your body. nothing can break that. I hope you feel better soon.
dont worry about it, just give time hopefully in coming year all will be better and we will be back normal life again. and you will not miss him much.
yes you can also try any one of them if you feel relaxed and don't think that you do anything wrong in front of your husband while he might feel comfortable to visit any place he want. but keep a safe distance while doing it.
maybe you just call him and talk about all this what he is doing for you and ask him how he is doing for you with love to break the up via video call. hope it will be helpful for you. Please have any faith in this and take vaccines as soon as you can.
yes try to find those things that make you happy and at the end try to go outside in 5 minutes and walk a bit and take a breath of fresh air and then come back inside and watch that movie and laugh for 20 minutes or so :) just 5 min and find your heart back

Hi, how are you? What would you like to talk about? One person only. Cannot really communicate in pairs. Am I missing anything? That is okay, I hope I was able to help! If not, please let me know too! So I may help!
I am sorry to hear that. How do you feel about her passing? What would make you feel less sad? Or is it just your mother? Maybe there's another way to help make this better for you. Do you have any other friends or family around to support you?
Don't let your feelings be selfish. If you do get another puppy, make sure it is just for you to deal with your emotions. Don't get another dog just because everyone else is around.
That sounds like a very nice surprise. I think you should do it and I'm sure you will be even happier if you are with a new dog. It will make you feel great. Dogs help you find happiness.
It is nice to know that you have your furry companion as a reminder of your time together as bestie. So even though things are lonely, you know that you two will always be there to comfort each other. It seems like you both do.
Well, I don't have one but I have dogs through volunteers who help people help them. It's good, because these dogs are not looking for themselves, they are looking for people to have relationships with.
Personally, I have a therapy dog named Max and he is a 2 year old Border Collie. His dog life is not all he thought it would be. I believe Max is an example of what is possible. My dogs are probably doing better than I am :) Ha ha.
That is great to hear. I hope you are not alone in feeling this way. Dogs are an excellent source of comfort and happiness. You should feel no guilty at all! You are a good person who deserve to have nice things in your life. Be happy! Thank you for speaking!
Well, I hope that is working out well for you! What else can you do at home? That might be a better option for everyone. I think you're doing a great job being a good host! You're the best! It might be good for the family too.
I'm sure he was happy to see you too! What kind of activities do you have planned for yourself? I know the pandemic has been a really hard year for everyone. My husband is a teacher and has been very stressed out. I've been trying to take care of him!
Well, it's been great chatting with you. And of course, feel free to text me anytime you need another chat! Be safe and I hope the rest of the day is great for you! Have a wonderful New Year! :) :) :)! :) :)! :D :) :) :)!
I wish you all the best for 2021! And thank you for talking to me. Take care! Goodbye! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!! :)!!! :)!! :)!! :)!! :)!! :)!! :)! :)!!
I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been feeling this way? Is there something in particular that has led to you feeling this way? Can you tell me more? I would like to understand what is bothering you. What specifically is causing you to be so sad?
I'm so sorry to hear that. That's really bad. Did this happen recently? Have you reported this to her yet? I would suggest that very soon, otherwise there will be a lot of grounds to take it to court. Have you tried to talk to her about this?
Ok. There are programs out there for deaf people to help them communicate. What do you think? I am not sure they would listen, though. Maybe you could take her out for a nice walk so she can get some fresh air and talk things over with her ex.
It sounds like a very tough situation. I would talk to her anyway even if you are deaf. Ask her what really happened and her apologies if that was not a lie. Is that the kind of person you want to be in a relationship with?
Oh wow that's very sad. I know how you feel. I had the same situation. I could only express myself through writing. I can show you a sketch of what I had during my times together. I hope this can help you.
Well, let me know if I can help you too :) Sign language is amazing! You could have each other by phone, right? Not by text. Is that something you can do? Do you want to tell her about this? I could go for a phone call myself.
I can tell you're upset about this very much. It can be very hard to stay loving when there's someone else you feel is wrong. When it comes to that I would go to see a professional, I think your counselor could be of great help.
Wow that's horrific... poor you! That isn't very healthy though... have you got anyone to talk to? There are mental health support services in almost all countries... it might help a little! Are there any friends you can reach out to? Do you live anywhere near a friend?
I'm really sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk to a professional? Maybe a midwife? Just suggesting... I hear it can help. I know it doesn't feel like it at the moment, but it will.
I am so sorry it took you this long to recognize the pattern of behavior. That is really too short a time. As a good friend I would probably take you to therapy, or maybe seek closure via a lawyer or department of correction.
No, not me, but I know some who have gotten on with someone after...all. Love doesn't just happen overnight and isn't good for anyone, I'm afraid. But, after 15 minutes, not 15 minutes, you will see you need a break.
I get what you're saying and I don't think Justin Bieber has hands, it's Justin Timberlake. Also, walls don't build themselves. Maybe you can find someone else who's a better basketball player or even a better soldier? Just a thought.
Oh man. That's tough. You have to let go of the resentment, but the resentment has to go through some self recounting first. It sounds like her actions make you, an emotionally impaired person, feel pain and self- defeat, I'm guessing.
And if he is a man who claims he doesn't have a hand do he let you deal with a man who has a hand? *laughs* Could it be worse than a power forward in the WNBA? I think it definitely could. I am sure he does not look like him.
Actually, yes, it does take a minute to grow them back and it can be a bit painful. Infection can also be a problem. But they can grow back and are okay. Though I do sometimes wake up with little bruises where I cut them, do I know why?
well, good luck to you! It's been nice chatting with you, despite all this!
ok :D Thanks. Enjoy!
I can't wait for Christmas and the New Year! :D :D Hope you have a lovely Christmas and all your best wishes for 2021! :D :D :D and your new boyfriend!
So you are saying that g.f broke your heart? How long have you been grieving? I am feeling a bit more hopeful because I can hear you are happy that you are feeling better now? You are not still grieves?
I am so sorry you had to go through that! What do you mean she broke your heart? Is she just there for a short time and will not stay? I am a bit concerned but your friendly tone made me worried that something bad could happen to you!
when did she end the relationship? or do you just think it's ended? You sound like you are still hurt. How do you feel? Is there anything you want to talk about or are you just looking for advice? I am here to listen. Let's get into it.
It's one of those things you never forget! Had you been with her long enough to suspect this, that's not so good! Have you thought about giving it another shot? Or perhaps speaking with your friend or another close family member? They might have a better perspective on this.
I understand what you mean, I am going through something similar right now and it sounds like the relationship has caused you a lot of feelings. I am so sorry. I think that you may need some time to be with yourself and get through all of this.
I think you should take some time to do something you enjoy. It sounds like the relationship was an important part of your life, so taking time to do your own things is important. Time can help heal and move on from the relationship. Have you thought of that?
Is there any activity that you have that makes you happy? Maybe talk about it! Are you interested in photography, singing or something else? Maybe doing that helps you take your mind off of things. What do you think? Have any fun plans?
It's okay to feel that way. For myself, it was really helpful to let out the emotions at an altar or outside in nature. :) It sounds like you could do that too? :D Good luck, and take care! :) Meet you there in person.
Maybe it will help you to also be distracted from the relationship and rekindle yourself? You can give yourself time to heal and focus on your own interests. Take care. :) Take some deep breaths.
Let your eyes relax from the problem and find some bliss in your life for once! Always remember, it can get better! Believe in yourself and keep moving forward! Good luck! :) Have a nice day! :) Thanks for chatting! :-).. :) and Thank you for being you :)!
Please don't think of this as a farewell. If anything I've been able to help you, you can do the same for others! Have a great day! :) Good luck to you! :)!! :) :)!! :)!! :) :)!! :)!! :)!!
Would you like to tell me about it? I am here to help. I'm sure it's frustrating to be anxious. Is there something in particular that's making you feel this way? Is it work, relationship issues, health problems, or something else?
Oh no I'm so sorry. How bad are you feeling about it? The coronavirus has been making everyone anxious for sure. Did you not get the news that your company laid you off? That must be so scary!
I would like to ask, what was the reason for the company laying you off? Was it layoffs or did they not feel you were ready for the job anymore? It seems like that furloughs are becoming a big issue at work and that would be distressing for you.
Do you think it is realistic that you may be laid off in the next quarter? There may be lot of options, such as a severance package or your family getting bread and eggs for a while. It is not your fault!
As I've struggled I've learned that mental health is EVERYTHING, at least for me. Have you tried seeing a therapist? If you are able? Is there someone in your area that would be helpful? I've found resources in my local community that can help too.
Have you got any investments or assets that you can lean on? I know that I can personally help with some finances but I think there must be other people out there who are totally in similar situations. Maybe a charity? Maybe there's a helpline to get people advice?
It sounds like a lot of people are struggling. There's a list on Reddit for medical help if you're interested. Therapy is wonderful! I'd be happy to give you a call and chat for a minute if you're interested. I've had years of experience with this too!
Exactly! You can definitely practice controlled breathing. I personally have found it to be a very beneficial exercise for reducing anxiety and increasing calm. Do you want to give it a try? What do you think? Do you feel comfortable trying it?
It is real proven in many studies to be very effective. If I were in your shoes, I'd try that. I'd see what works for you. Maybe see how it puts you in a state of calmness and bring back your spirits. It's also great for physical health.
A job loss can put your financial stability to the test! I'm positive you will get back on your feet, and have tons of great experiences! :) Wishing you the best! You're an awesome person! May you be thankful for the day you woke up feeling like a good person!
May you find peace and quiet! Have a great night!
If you have any other issues you need help with, I'm glad to assist! Good luck to you! :) Outside of the pandemic, my hope for you is that you find the inner peace you're looking for! May the stars align in your life.
I'm doing well, how are you? Why are you here? Can I help you? I can sit down and go over everything with you? Anyone issues today? Or did you just need to talk? What is it that I can help you with? My door is always open.
I can see from what I can hear that you are really heartbroken and feel that you did everything possible to do things with your friends and they never reciprocated. The mask issue was a huge problem as well, I understand that. Not everyone is healthy enough to wear a mask.
I'm sorry to hear that. It seems like your friends have been very unwelcoming towards you. It makes me worry about your mental health and a possible substance abuse. There are likely other friends who are missing out on discussions and being present for you.
I have had similar situations with friends. It is true, as you get older you feel like you are the only one doing anything to maintain friendships so they keep pushing back and becoming distant. Try asking them why it is and they may be able to have a nice conversation.
So what do you think is causing this? I understand you are feeling disrespected and you don't feel like you are contributing to the conversation when you are being busy taking precautions. Am I correct in my understanding of what is going on?
I can understand that... I have been in similar situations before where I reached out to people with the intention of meeting with them but they seemed to ignore my messages. But you can't feel bad about that because if it was not you who made the effort then it was not a personal thing.
You need a strong family and possibly some other friends who can also relate to how frustrating this time is. Social distancing has been awful on everyone, and most have felt like they are getting what they didn't deserve.
It's great that you are reaching out and connecting with friends. However, I understand it can be hard to know what others are doing and what their relationship with family and friends is like.
I see you are a creative person and enjoy music, that is great. That is a good coping mechanism for missing out on people. It's really easy to get left behind and so many people in our time of crisis aren't coming out of their houses.
Do you think the ice rink could provide a nice and warm space for you to meet new people while still following all the guidelines? It could be a more casual scene than playing hockey where it's more likely that the ice will be open but it's still indoors.
You're most welcome. Just remember to wear your mask and if you want to go to the store wear your gloves as well. I hope you have fun when you can visit. Hang in there! You can do it! haha! Don't you go getting depressed or anything.
Have a great day!
Thank you. Merry Christmas to you and to you as well! Is there anything else you would like to talk about? Or is this part of your Christmas survey? We still have some time to go though. Please do feel free to share your thoughts.
I am a half brttain native. Merry Christmas to you! :) Can you press quit from your end so I can end the chat and take my survey? :) You have to press quit or you will be served out of this chat :) ;) :) :) ;) :) ;) :) :)!
How are you doing today? How was your day? I could ask more than one question! I enjoy talking to you. What do you want to talk about? I don't get paid to give advice. You could get advice from your friends if you need.
Things are tough right now. But I know it will get better soon. What would you like to talk about? Do you want to share your feelings? I am here to listen if that's okay with you! :) Mid is nice. Give me a minute just to wait :) Wonderful.
I am sorry to hear that. What is it about being depressed that has you in a state of depression? Is it something to be particular about yourself? Or it is to be in general?
That is so horrible, I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about what happened? How is your depression affecting your day to day life? My family has been struggling with depression during COVID-19 and I can understand why that would affect you.
Have you tried therapy to help deal with your depression? I know that had a lot of benefit for me. May I suggest your local option? There may be free resources online if that's an option. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
It sounds to me that you may have grown to become stronger from the experience. That can be especially good if there have been healthier relationships in the future. I have never been in a situation like this before, but I have come to realize that people change most noticeably in relationships.
Since you are a strong person I think you would be able to continue to grow as you have already shown such resilience. In that way you may still find happiness in life. What do you think? Do you feel you could possibly share your feelings with someone, perhaps a trusted friend?
Well, that would be hard but with empathy from your partner there is still hope. What happens if there isn't enough empathy? If you don't have someone empathetic you will likely never get back into a sexual relationship with someone who has seen that sort of abuse happen.
Yes, you can still tell your new partner about the past, but it should be a casual conversation and not pressuring. You can let them know that you still care for your past experiences, but don't have to go into a lot of details.
It's great that you are so cautious, and I know that you'll find the right person and enjoy the relationship. Great chatting! :) Have a wonderful evening!
You are very welcome, I'm sure you will make great connections tomorrow. All the best for the rest of your week. I wish you a happy holidays. Thanks again! :) *smile* :)!! :)!! :D :) :) : ; ) :! :)!
I'm well, how are you? how can I help you? maybe I can read you? we may have that option. y'all can't seem to hear the others sometimes, right? could I do something to help? we could talk over a few questions?
Do you have a spouse? Did you divorce? Not affordable for him? I am worried. Can you tell me your story? Have you lost someone close? A child? A kid? Friend? Family member? I am here to listen to you!
I agree with you and I also faced this at my place. It's really is a hard position to be in.
That is tough. And you have a lot on your plate with the parents not supporting you. Do you have any family you can reach out to? I have cousins I can go to if you would like to tell me a bit more about the situation.
I can feel the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' from you, I feel your isolation during this difficult time. Maybe taking a different approach is an option?
hi i've been there. any step you can take helps. not sure if i can keep up with that kind of physical activity or mental activity. haha i want to help but i need the normal as well.
Of course! I wish you the best in coaching! Stay in touch! Have a great evening to! I can't see it but it is totally awesome. Good luck to you and to everyone out there! You are all amazing! Thank you. You as well! See you tomorrow!
do not leave the room as I can not give you the finish as your message is incomplete for me. Hope you all do better on your Coaching next. Bye bye and thank you. Anything else you can provide?
Hello, how are you today? Would you like to talk about anything in particular? If so, it sounds like there might be something bothering you right now. I want to make sure I can help if that's the case. The world can be a very tough place, right?
What is happening today? Anything in particular you'd like to talk about? It is good for the body and mind. Do you want to talk about it? Try to get to the root of why you are feeling this way. Have you had anything happen recently?
Is there anything you'd like to talk about that is making you feel emotional? I'd be happy to listen if you'd like to share. I care! :) How are you feeling? Specifically, what is making you feel emotional? Maybe we can work through it together?
Ah I understand, that sounds very difficult. Have you considered a career change? Maybe there are areas that you can gain more experience in that might lead to an opportunity? I have known of a few other people that have worked their way into jobs in fields they weren't good at.
What kind of jobs are you looking for? Or have you gotten any job interviews already? Do you have a resume? I would suggest picking the best resume ever! Do you have a resume? Do you have any contacts in your field of interest?
That is not a very good situation. I don't really have a specific field I work in, but I am a admin assistant, so if you'd like I can give you some tips in that area. Has there been any potential in a new field? Maybe so you could transition later on?
Have you tried working from home? That often works well for people. The only problem is you're probably alone and you need to spend time interacting with other people. Do you feel that you could go to places outside to meet other people? A park or a coffee shop?
I understand that. I was trying to move on from college but needed work to pay the bills. If you keep trying, I bet you'll find a job! That's what I always say! No one is giving up on you, you're doing your best! :) How old are you?
What would make you happy? What are your goals? What are your passions? Do you like writing? Or painting? Do you like interacting with people? So many jobs offer experience. Maybe there is something specific you are looking for? Try out a few new fields.
Well I hope the vaccine is in no time! Especially important for all the renters out there! But no need to be scared, every big company will soon start paying everyone who is owed. In fact, Amazon is promising eventually. They are working on giving each person more options.
So maybe you can discuss with your daughter an outside job? Many people started freelance writing, designing, and other jobs online right after the pandemic started! I know they can do them when people started to feel a little more comfortable. That might be an option! How old are you?
It's really hard but you are basically free from worrying about the rent, though it will be worth the wait when the vaccine is on our side. And I can tell you are in good company, you are being a good friend for only moving in a month!
Absolutely, we have to believe that things will get better in the future. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about or any other questions you have for me? I am here to listen if you need me to do anything else. Thank you!
You are welcome! I hope you have a great rest of the week and good luck! I hope your daughter is doing well! I really enjoyed our conversation! You are a great person and I wish you the best! :>) sounds like you completed 2 sessions so far!
You are more than welcome. Good luck! May I help with anything else? Please be safe and take care. Bye! Stay Safe! :) Bring it on! You got this! :) Best luck! :D. Best Wishes! :) This chat has ended!
You can't sleep at night? Can you explain what is wrong? How long you could sleep? How long could not sleep? What is wrong? Why? What you did? What you eat? What you drink? Or any thing? Or you did something? What is wrong?
I find myself having difficulty sleeping as well. Have you tried a massage? Sometimes massages can help work out the issue. There is also a mobile massage therapist in our area who may be able to provide a service. I think they might be able to help as well. You might find it useful.
How would you describe your personal feelings about being single? Do you have friends? A spouse? You seem to be focusing on the negative part of being single. Do you have any mutual friends or family? Just having a conversation about this is helping me.
I can feel as though I am not supported when I am feeling insecure. Has there been a past traumatic experience that could be the reason for your insecurity? I think this may be the cause. It is something that I personally have struggled with.
Have you thought about talking with a therapist or someone close to you who will be there to support you? Someone you feel you could be honest with. They may be able to suggest some remedies. I have found talking with someone who has had similar issues to be helpful.
There are a lot of good anxiety herbs that you can try to keep you secure for sleep. Do you have any tried and tested? Sometimes a night in with a good book does work. What is your preference? I enjoy a good romance novel. Does this help?
Have you tried talking to any of your friends? Maybe someone close will have a solution. Do you have a family member to whom you could discuss your problem? Families can be of great support. Have you done this before? I have and it often works very well. Maybe you will.
I wish you very well and I hope you get the help you need. Good luck to you. Can I give you the survey sheet at the end of our session. :) I can do it from my end as well. If you need more assistance then I am here.
The problem you are having and the cat idea is an excellent combination. You would find comfort and companion in the cat. You can now share your worries and stress with your cat for care. You will find comfort. They love to be played and cuddled. So you are in good hands.
I know how you feel. I have also slept disturbed because of working a long shift of 24 hours. But if you're sleeping well, then you will be able to find peace. As I mentioned before, I believe that it will help you to relieve your pain.
Do you have any ideas on how to improve your sleep? Maybe you can try learning new mindfulness techniques to help you relax. If not, I can understand where the discomfort in your sleep might be coming from. If I can be of assistance, I hope this message has been helpful to you.
There are all sorts of outdoor toys and calming drinks. Have you tried out calm recipes to make soothing drinks for your kitty. As well, there are comfort toys that cats like. Maybe you could decorate your living space with some such items? It may help.
I am glad to hear that, is there anything else I can help with for you? I hope you have a wonderful week and a smooth end to the month. Bye. :) Goodbye! :) Is there a way you can end it from your end? I can't!
No problem! Do you feel you will get some more assistance or resolution? I was willing to listen and help. Take care. Goodnight! Your friend. :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :). :) :).
Sometimes just putting the conversations you are having into action has been very helpful for me in the past. Is this something you may be able to try out? I hope you will let me know and hope this helps! I hope you sleep well tonight! :) hopefully this will help you.
I am so sorry to hear that! Have you been depressed for a long time or just recently? Maybe there is something specific that has caused it? I would recommend talking to a friend or family member. Let us get through these days and hit them head on! What has caused it?
Ouch! That sounds awful. Have you ever thought of going back to your old job? Perhaps it might be the end of the road for you, though. That is not exactly good for your mental health.
Do you have any support around you? I feel as though I am missing out on so much of the world in the pandemic, though! Social distancing is really a blur. Have you spoken to your loved ones at all? Maybe they could give you a bit of a boost?
For sure the world is a very difficult place right now. It would be almost impossible to convince oneself to think that it gets any better. This is most definitely a very challenging year. But you are definitely right to feel that it gets better! I really hope it does! Especially for you!
Cool! I think one of the best things you can do is make a plan and set some goals. Have a ranking of the top three, so you know where to focus your energy.
I think it's just a matter of trying new things and doing them one by one. For instance, if you know you are going to be in a bad mood, the best thing to do would be to do your own car in that time!
Yes, I recently joined a gym and it has really helped me. It also helped me to get fit but even better, I have met some really friendly people. Have you tried any physical therapy lately? That often really helps. I heard it's free. I'm doing it regularly.
I think that a good book or audiobooks are also great things to make you more productive. Not too much work though and no reading time wasted. Do you like books? I've been really enjoying being a Widow since the pandemic started. I don't know when it will all be over.
Well, I suppose you can keep your cat and then get your cat's habit under control, sort of. :) That's what I think happened for me.
It seems you are very good at remembering what you must do. Good for you. The advice I was getting was that do something that pleases your mind. I was never able to do that in my life until I had pets. I love talking to them.
Well I am a bit confused - I think you can just move to a new home and your cats can stay. Would you mind if I said I am a bit suspicious that you are in one of those situations? But I suppose that's not possible...
What is your address, I am in Northamptonshire. I am assuming this is UK? I don't know but I don't know any of the rules :). Good luck! It has been good chatting with you!
That is a fantastic idea. Just make sure to follow all the covid safety rules and stay apart of course. Good luck and I hope everything takes a positive turn for you :) ITs a tough year for everyone! :D. Thank you for chatting!
I'm not sure how they work, but perhaps they can give you a starters pack? :P (All sorts of unwanted veggies and scraps and such.) Is that something you could do? Maybe look for something online too? :) No pressure at all! I'm sure you will do great!
Nice chatting with you and stay positive! Now go and enjoy the rest of your evening! :) Best regards! :) You need to press quit! :) Try again from your end! :)" You need to press quit! :) Try again from your end!
Im doing alright thanks, my teeth are hurting and I have been feeling stressed lately how are you?, i'm concerned you may be better than me., Im sorry to hear that your tooth is hurting but would you like to tell me more about it?, your pain has really been bothering you
would you be willing to talk about why you are having a bad day today? I am here to listen and give you some help if I can. Do you mind me asking? I will do my best to try and help you! What is bothering you? In the chat box?
i am sorry to hear that I have been in a similar situation at work, but I do not know how you got your job now. do you feel like you lost it through no fault of your own? or by doing something wrong? how did your husband take the news?
it may not be an easy situation but it can get better. especially with the lockdown. anything can happen from this situation. you know that right? :) and you have been with him a long time and have something special so do not forget about the partnership.
this can be very stressful and tear you apart. have you ever considered having a different people to talk to about this issue. families, or another friend and confidant? tríoking about this will probably help. we tend to get so frustrated that we don't know how to deal with it.
did you try to avoid arguing over this to the point where it got to this point. is this the reason why your husband is angry with you? and why does he not help out the kids? might you be holding onto this resentment of you think you have wronged him more than you realize.
it sounds like your family has been through a lot since the pandemic started as well. it seems like he wants a lot of attention from you, but you are doing so much for your kids and pets. I am sure your feelings are right up there with theirs too.
have you tried to see why your husband has been acting this way? He seems like a great person. Give it some more time. It just takes time. Eventually he will see your kids really well and start to care about them more.
you should try to tell your kids how much you dislike their father because of him. they should understand why. kids do not like dirty parent. kids get dirty when they are inside the house and your dad is not giving you a chance to clean.
i think they can at least talk in peace. Maybe a person from their medical office could help to work things out. Since you dont have insurance. there is a lot of resources for it. and it is easy to get and accessible. Even online.
The kids can do it easily, you just have to take care of yourself. you are both adults so you can take care of each other too. That's why we have these problems in the first place. If you want to change it, just one day. Do that for yourself for once.
Please try to stay strong and try to avoid the situation if you can. The kids are the next thing to your family. They are the responsibility of yours. You must see them as your family. Do not leave them with your husband. that would be very hard on them.
Just call him up and tell him that you both agree that you should take your kids out for a break. Tell him that you are tired of trying and take your kids. If he says he will work on it, well, than you know he is paying attention.
Are you two in the same relationship? If not, I would suggest that he try to understand why you two are so disheartened about the situation. My brother was a tool of the people. He had no motive to keep you two together.
No problem! Try to stay positive and stay strong! If things dont go back to normal, you should start looking for help. There might be other people that can do it for you. Thats good thing to do. Someday you can be free from your stress!
If you have any other question you can ask me. Good luck! And happy holidays! Hope it goes back to normal soon! :) good luck in the new year! :) Is there anything else you want to discuss or ask? :) Can I help you anything else today?
I'm sorry to hear that! Can you tell me more about it? Maybe there is a way to get it under control? I am here to listen! Omg maybe I can even help? It's okay! It's normal to not be feeling so well from time to time!
What seems to be going on? Is this illness new or has it happened before? Both are valid excuse though. And I am here to listen and help if you would like. What is it that is making you not feel well?
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you seen any illness lately? Flu, rhinitis, allergy. Something that could be causing this? Could you go over your doctor's appointments and what is the latest you've seen? Maybe even go visit the doctor.
Sometimes a walk outside is good. If you have a freezer and icepacks in your fridge you can make ice cubes and then the cold is soothing. Sometimes having a bowl of oatmeal or cereal is good as well.
You feel stuck and that is easy to feel that way so don't be too hard on yourself. Know your inner self it always is worth your while to know how your mind is thinking because that has a lot to do with your self-worth.
I have found it helpful to meditate when I am feeling overwhelmed it is a great way to clear the mind. I know it sounds weird but it really helps in putting things into perspective. Do you have a meditating routine or do you find it hard to get into a meditating habit?
Are you feeling stuck because of your job? Or is it a general anxiety issue? I've felt the same way about the pandemic and worried about my future. My partner was worried that we would never work again and were so stressed about it.
I understand that sounds really rough you must feel that way I have heard of jobs that have been affected like that. When you are feeling down it is important to take care of yourself and maybe take a rest to not feel overwhelmed.
That sounds pretty rough I am also struggling with that right now. Do you think of looking at different industries maybe online? I am an admin and am taking online courses for job prep right now. Can you think of someone you know who can give you some advice?
If you work out of your home you are saving money and getting more work done at the same time. Would that appeal to you? Or is it hard for you to do that? It can be a win-win for you and your work. Is that something you are interested in?
I understand your concern with student loan debt especially with the pandemic and all the new requirements that have come with it i understand your fear also. Maybe you should consider looking into MOOCs for student loans but i would only consider that if you already have one that is already paid off.
I actually take MOOCS in music and I know alot of things are transferable to many other fields I personally like a studytrombone to watch music and what is being made now and how it will be made for the next 10 years I dont like most music being made with laptops it
That is amazing, it is a good thing you are willing to do that as it shows your determination and a good heart. Do you ever talk to friends about your studies? Sometimes it helps to talk about it with a friend or family member you can share your feelings with them.
Yeah there are but the tech industry is doing way better than most of the other industries right now I would say stay away from any small companies that can't afford their employees and go to those big companies if you see that it's working for them they might have some other jobs to offer or a better
But we just need to take care of each other so we all can make it through this difficult time. Can you do that? Please :) have any ideas or just ignore it? I am trying to help and thank you for talking.
Maybe try and look into that for a start and if you're comfortable with it just see how it goes. If you find you can't, then you don't have to continue. But do you find yourself doing anything at all for self care at all?
Yes keep pushing for it and you will not regret it! Your well being and productivity will thank you. :) :) :) 👍 youre very welcome! i hope everything goes smooth for you. I hope you take my suggestion and other suggestions and ideas can really help you in the coming days!
my pleasure!
You are most welcome have a great day! Bye :) thank you for the chat. My pleasure! Bye :D and from you :) Come in for further chat anytime!!
are you able to end the session now?
Best of luck to you :) - a parting song :) :) :) :)!
I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit about it? I am happy to listen. What is going on? Is there something specific on your mind? I am happy to listen. Please do not feel sad, do not be so sad. Just talk about it.
I can see that you are upset with yourself for making the same mistake in the past. So what do you feel when you are mad at yourself for this? Is there any reason why you trusted him again? Is he in a position to hurt you now?
I hear you saying you are mad at yourself for trusting him again. That is understandable, and you should be honest with yourself about that. Just because he did that once does not mean you should distrust him more. I know it can be a problem.
I can understand how you feel. But please remember that you are not alone. There are people that are willing to listen and understand what you are going through right now. Is there anyone you are close with? Friends? Family? Friendships?
Was there ever a problem with the relationship that you could talk to him about? Maybe he was trying to get out? And how long was the relationship? I am so sorry that it happened now. Is there anything we can do to help you? I am going to share something with you.
Have you tried to reach out to him and just talk about it? Maybe you could work together to get through this? It might be better to talk to him about it, just let him know how much his behavior bothered you. Does that make sense? :) Would you be willing to try?
What made you lose faith in him? He promised to never cheat again? I can understand how this happened to you. That seems to be the worst part of this situation. Does that make sense? If you are comfortable with it, I would consider moving on.
Perhaps his actions were a sign of who he was and that he wasn't ready for anything real for him. Make sense? There's been a lot going on with you. Does that explain anything? I am just starting out in this all too, how are you feeling? Most days?
For a long time, I feel like we are stuck in our past, and it's hard to move forward. It may take some time to heal. A year has passed. Hopefully you are learning a lot from that experience and growing from it.
When I was in the military my first boyfriend made me chew my nails! What did he do? So I appreciate the honesty of your message and you're so wise and strong. Your man is not alone. People can apologize. People do that. It takes a big person to do that.
Have you considered speaking with a counselor? Maybe they can give you some advice on dealing with this? Would you consider it? Do you feel you would want a counselor? I'd love to help you both with some suggestions. Is there anything else I can do?
How about having a group therapist work through this with you? It might help you feel better. Keep in mind that everything heals at some time. Is there anything else I can help you with? How about fun things to do this weekend? What do you like to do?
Oh okay. Well, do you want to take a moment to feel happy about not having that person in your life? I think that would be helpful. What does the antidepressant medication do? You can always do your own research to find out what works best for you.
I see you are trying to work out this situation. Would you try to find out what her name was? Are you sure he didn't cheat in the past? Why did he have a past relationship? Is it really stupid for him to do that? Maybe he has shown some immaturity before.
I have feelings like this before. It took me a while but it got better for me. I gave it some time. A few weeks maybe a month... just give it some time. I recommend one person per day to yourself. What would you like to do with that person?
I think that you need to start going back to some of the things that are positive in your life. It sounds like a lot of you have been doing. This might be good for you. Have you gotten any other hobbies back in your life that you used to do?
I have a feeling that you just need to relax and let the healing process work itself out. I'm sure you're strong and capable of overcoming anything! We need to keep working on it though, it's not easy. Do you have a support system? Family? Friends? Support groups?
That is amazing! You have a special connection with this person and will find each other! It's great that you are being optimistic! :) I know you are too! You will find someone with you! :) You are awesome! :) Maybe try talking to him about your feelings?
Of course! Is there anything else I can do to help? You were in the mood for a chat today :) :) Good Luck! Have a great day! :) :) :) :) :) :) : ) :) :)! :) :) :) :) :) : ) :) :)! :) :) :) :)!
Hi there! How are you? What can I help you with today? :) Please, state what. Is there anything you would like to talk about?? Or do you have some issues you would like to express to someone? :) I'm here to help. When do you want to start?
So you're having a really bad time right now? I'm sorry to hear that, this has been an absolutely awful year. How do you feel like you're breaking point is? Is it specifically related to COVID or is it something else that's affecting you?
I can understand how you feel as I am also in a similar situation and trying to balance my work and personal life as well. I've been experiencing a lot of stress trying to get things done in my life and work.
Does any of your friends and family come to visit you? And do you have a hobby that you can give up for a while? Or do you have anything special that you can give yourself? Finding new ways to connect with your life might be one way to you to feel less like giving up.
As for feeling like giving up, try re-reading a plan you have set, and start to update it with what you feel you will accomplish.
You sound like a very responsible and dedicated person. It seems you are proactive about dealing with your stress, making excuses was also a good thing in helping you see what's really happening.
That is great. Check it off! Check it off! That is a great start. You should be very proud. You are not alone. Many people in this situation do feel hopeless. It is very common. You can never go as far as to feel you are not good enough.
To be honest, I made up the note card index card thing. I think a little tug of progress helps keep you on track and motivated. :) Happy to help! I hope you have a great rest of the day. Take care! :) best regards! :) best wishes!
Take a few more circles, you can draw anything you want, because that is the reward! I hope you have a lot of fun at the party, too! Come home and get your rewards! haha Have fun, there is always another adventure for me to go on!
If you think you can keep a routine with a balanced health fit, you must try to use the rewards that come from it! If not, you can always try to put in more and more of them. Do you know if you can keep a healthy-ish routine or make any attempts?
Yes. Are there any personal medical conditions that I can help you with? There may be lessons you can teach yourself using technology on your own? You seem to be motivated and confident in my assessment. That is a positive place to start.
Im a little sleepy right now. How are you? :D and what can I help you with? Can you tell me more about your situation? I am really listening and willing to help.
I can understand why you're feeling that way. During covid, it's been hard for us to just relax and enjoy the world around us. Is there anything I can do to help you? Sorry to hear you have trouble going out in the first place.
Have you had any meetings or went to the store lately? There are ways to outsource which I find helpful sometimes. I get too stressed trying to find some what but what are some ways to outsource for me? What do you plan on doing recently? Do you need help looking up what?
Do you see others at the office? I think a lot of them are just having similar issues. I'm interested in learning what can help you go out if needed. Of course, it's not a lot. You have to walk, use public transportation, maybe even walk.
That's not a problem. You have to be careful though as you don't want to overexert yourself. I'm just trying to be mindful of myself for health purposes. How have you coped with it? What have you done so far? What does your new work situation look like?
I think it's hard to make changes when we're used to being in an environment for a while. Do you think this might change after the holiday season? It's currently December which makes me feel a little insecure in that i have to go back to my normal school schedules.
Then even if the bar is a mile away you can just walk in and order a drink. They'll know if you're wearing your workout clothes or the bar won't serve you. It might be a little dirty or stinky so don't worry.
I am pretty sure it's not normal for you to be out at a bar anymore and it's not safe and it's probably not the most respectful towards other people either. How about going to a nearby park and doing some walking?
That makes sense. It's great that you have a workout buddy but I understand how hard it can be when everyone is home and stuck indoors, even if you do go out and run. I think this is why people are getting so down and people are missing their friends.
What do you think you can do to reconnect with your friends? Things like virtual gatherings or suggestions about how to re-initiate connections? My personally I've been trying to reach out via message, to try and get inside of our bubbles again. And then everyone is together at a time.
I personally use Facetime, have actually played some games with my friends online while they're on the other end. I like to think that at least we can have a sense of normalcy. Have you tried any of these methods? Or do you have another idea?
I think the key might be to find a mix that works for you. Even if that's just a short amount of time to connect with your friends. Maybe you could try calling or texting every other week and see if that helps. I think it could be a good middle ground.
That sounds like a great plan. Being outside with your dog can be very therapeutic. Do you work from home? It has been more stressful for you? And do you feel that your husband and kid's remote learning has been stressing you out as well?
Does this mean you are looking forward to meeting your dog in the park? Is there anything else you wanted to talk to me about or ask? Maybe any hobbies or activities you can do now? The COVID was so difficult and stressful.
No problem. You are welcome. Are you able to talk more about this so I can give you some other suggestions? I have a lot of experience with kid activity and coping strategies. I want to make sure you feel comfortable with what I am proposing!
You too! Have a great day! :) Good luck with your health, and your work. I know it's tough, but you're doing your best, and that's all any of us can do. Hope you'll get some rest soon. And I think you will.
I am doing very well. How about you? Anything going on that you would like to talk about? Something pressing? Not pressing but you'd like to have someone talk with. You're welcome to say anything. I will listen! :) try to find something.
Of course! You could share your concern first, and see if I can help. Is there something on your mind? I am here to listen. Do you want to share? :D Which type of encouragement would you like to get?
What is your goal that you are trying to accomplish today? What seems to be the problem? What are the required actions to achieve your goal? Please share the details! They may help me to understand the scenario. best of luck!! :) Thank you.
Of course I have. I too had a difficult situation in my career. And that is where I used that tough situations to get stronger and learn from it. There are ways to improve. Never give up on your dreams. Something is definitely working in your life.
I am sure you can overcome anxiety if you find it's a routine. To reduce your anxiety please make a schedule for your work and your lunch time, in that way you can avoid overthinking and anxiety. Do you want to tell me about your previous experience?
You should also know that don't need to learn how to work alone. You can learn how to work alone with the guidance of other. From online classes, mastermind groups and team mates. You can also join any social group that you want to join.
Time heals all wounds. Time heals all the wounds, but not the pain. I also want to say, your paytime is coming soon. You should not stress so much. Do not worry about your job. Stay at your current job. Just give some extra work.
I do not have any dependents but in the age I am 20 years old but they will be in the future time of me. Don't worry. We have to learn this from ourselves because only we can do this. You should do it with a strong will.
You are welcome. I love talking with you. You are doing great. Now you have to just keep working hard. That will be your happiness. All the best to you. Bye. Believe in yourself. And always keep up to date and review your work regularly.
Thanks you as well and thanks for speaking with me. I Hope I will be there to help you as well. Bye!.Thank You. :).To pursue your goal and be with your family, you have to be positive. Never give up. Stay alive. Its my hope. :).
Is your job causing you to feel burnt out? Or is it that you are feeling overwhelmed at work? I am here if you want to talk more about this? I know this is not always easy to do but its a very common thing to happen. It's not something to be ashamed of.
I would try to ask your boss to meet and make sure you are working efficiently and to keep track of what you are doing. You could also consider asking your line manager to help with the workload.
Are you new to your job? I personally like to look out for my colleagues and will talk to my manager about how things are going. It really makes a difference when someone understands. As a new employee, can you provide examples of your workload?
Is she there if you want to talk about the budget? Maybe she can understand your situation when you are there. That can sometimes be a trap if they don’t want to hear you out.
Are there any office workers that you can talk to? Maybe someone they know? Sometimes, smaller companies will look for workers for small jobs to fill in while others are more stuck in a rut. You might look for a job as an office helper, or work in retail. Maybe some other career.
Can you get out of your contract if you can't get a job? We all feel like we've hit a glass ceiling in this pandemic. You have some skills that people are willing to pay for.
Maybe you just need someone to talk to. Have you talked with friends? They could listen without judging. Right now, we have a lot of friends to help. If not, you could do online dating. It is never too late. You can find a new job if you apply online.
Would you talk to HR about the situation? Maybe some solution or recognition of your contributions? What about how long you can continue here? 6 months or year? That would give you time to figure out what's going to happen next. What do you think?
That sounds really tough. I think we are all feeling stuck in some way these days. How can I help you? Sorry it's not exactly working out! Do you think your parents will help you if you leave? Have you spoken to anyone about your troubles?
That sounds like a tough job. Don't think you're alone. Many people are going 14 hours a day, six days a week. That doesn't mean you're worthless! You're definitely not worth one. It's the market out there.
If you're working 14 hour days, taking a break, just 30 minutes, back into the office might help. Your health and outlook could use it! :) So important. Both in the long and short term. Maybe you could talk to your HR department or your manager about your workload!
Do you have any friends? Maybe you could go out for dinner with some friends after work and before bedtime. They're good to know! Do you take classes? Something to shift your focus from work! Maybe get yourself into another project. Adventure or something.
That's a very pessimistic and harsh way to see things. I hope it won't take you too long to get through the upcoming year. Try to take things one day at a time, because things aren't going to get better if you just keep adding stress to your life.
That's even worse than that. If they are ignoring you then they won't listen to you, they probably have no intention of doing it. I hope you don't give up, keep telling them you're not going anywhere. Keep pushing and insisting.
I completely agree with you. Have you started taking an acting role, maybe for the benefit of your career? It's worth a try, and who knows? I'm sure there are managers out there who will understand that your frustration with them could improve your career if you start expressing yourself positively.
I'm good! But could you tell me what's bothering you? What is on your mind today? If you don't mind me asking, I'd be happy to listen! If not, you can share without me asking. Either way! :) I'm here to listen.
That is awful to hear. Are there any specific people you are referring to? There are a lot of mean people out there. I would like to know if they are school people? Children? Adults? One or more? Was this happening recently? How often do they make fun of you?
Yes, I know what it's like not to have much money. However, you are not alone. There is a lot of support available for people who are bullied. I believe you could go to a local support group to help you! Do you have any family around you? Are you close?
Okay, so all you want to do is just get your clothes looking better? Do you think they are bad because you don't like them? Possibly they don't sound good, but that doesn't mean they are not good. Some people see style in all aspects of life!
Maybe try looking online? There are a lot of different ways to buy clothes online, aren't there? Do you think you could be buying anything you need? You do not have to buy clothes, you can just look. Do you think there is anything that might help with your self image?
Really not! You don't have to change anything because you love yourself just the way you are. I am sure that everything will turn out alright. Have you tried to talk to a friend or family member who thinks you look good?
I think you are absolutely right. Unfortunately life is a series of challenges and you cannot always trust your own opinions of other people. However you do seem to have a good sense of self and have been through a tough time. I think that you can rise from this problem!
I think that's a good idea! I do a lot of alteration work with clothes when I'm working as a tailor. We don't just dress the person, we make them look better through dressing them right. I would recommend finding a sewing class and then learning how to alter clothes!
Would you like to try sewing? It's very versatile and can help you get your money's worth out of your clothes. All you need to get started is a sewing machine, scissors, needles and some spare thread.
That's great to hear! Do you know what therapy is? I've heard that it's really helpful. I did a few sessions myself when I was going through this phase. Maybe you could consider that? And by the way, I hope your day has been going well despite your discomfort!
I hope you do as well :) Bye! See you in the future.
You too! Have a nice one :) Bye! :) Can you press quit? ;D...
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it? Why do you no longer talk to your best friend? Was it a disagreement or something else? Why do you feel sad and angry about it? Did you fight or something? Or was it just a forgetfulness?
So, it seems like she was away from you for an extended period of time and as a result, you grew distant with each other, leading to your downfall. Am I correct? Is that what happened? Am I right? I am understanding, though.
Oh I understand. That sounds very bad. Do you know her again or did she have any other excuse besides lying to you? It sounds like this was a one-time thing that you don't feel you can fully trust her right now. Am I right?
I completely understand that. That can be really difficult to know that others may not understand your decision and feel that you made it for the wrong reasons. But I know you made the right decision for yourself and your own mental health and well-being.
You are feeling used. So my understanding is that you are still feeling hurt by your friend as a result of the false friendship? I think that this is a pretty common reaction.
I'm glad you found a quote that helped you. I do think you'll get through this and your other friend will understand you better once this is resolved. I hope you continue to find the strength to do what's best for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
You sound like you are working through some insecurities or guilt. I'm proud of you. These things can totally happen to us. It sounds like you did a great job by speaking up and that it took you to realize this.
I don't think it's either of those things. You are not stupid. You are just willing to do what you thought was best for your friend. Why do you feel that you are soft? Did your friend not treat you well? Have you done anything to make it right between you two?
It is all about reflection. You will eventually come to realize you thought it was helpful to be there for her, but she was lying and space and lying weren't it. And eventually you will be left to learn from the experience yourself.
I wish you all the best, good luck and your happiness! Would you like to talk about any other issues at all? I'm here. :) Hope I've been able to be helpful. I wish you all the best and God be with you.
You can come back to me if you need to talk more about this. My door is always open. I hope you feel better. Good luck! :P :) you are welcome. hope I was of service! :D :) you take care and stay safe.
You as well! Bye for now. :) Beautiful sunrise! :) Thank you for talking! :) You have a great day and keep your heart healed! :) Hope to catch you next. :) You are in my thoughts! :) They really do help! :) Thanks.
What is going on with your friend that makes them want to drink? Has this always happened? Can you share more about their situation with you? I am sure I could help you. How long has this been going on? Is it a certain situation or maybe a negative thought pattern?
Is your friend going through a rough time personally or due to drinking issues? Like what triggers it? Or is it just an emotional stage of your friendship? Can you give me more details? Perhaps it will help me to understand better. What is your friendship with this person like?
What makes this difficult for you? Your heart for them? You witnessing this through a phone call or video chat? Are you able to support them physically? Maybe offering to go for a walk? Any means you could be involved in their life without knowing they do not want it.
What are their main reasons for continuing to drink? Is there a particular situation? I mean, they might be feeling lonely? Is that part of their problem? Or is there a different reason?
I hear you. It's as if he's so desperate for a fix that he just can't stop. Well I'm not a doctor, but in my experience it's hard to fix something that is already destroyed. Are there any hobbies or interests that you could use as a distraction?
This can be the most difficult part for those close to an alcoholic, and I understand the struggle. It is often helpful for those in the same situation to be seen as a source of support for each other.
I think you need to reconsider the friendship and tell him you want to end it. Your health and well being are your top priority right now. You can't feel good when someone you care about is drinking and fighting. Take care of yourself. I hope it ends this way.
Have you talked to his family about it? Or his friends? Sometimes they can see how concerned you are for him and offer some more guidance. Maybe they can help put him on a path. Sometimes that is all that can do. But don't lose hope.
You are a good friend. And you should feel proud of yourself. Being a good friend to a soul is not as easy as anyone else is probably not aware of. The tips we had on this chat would be useful as well. Great to have you here. I hope you are doing well.
Its not easy to deal with someone struggling like that though. Have you looked into counseling for yourself, too? It might help you deal with your feelings. My own friend, who is an alcoholic, he was really good at finding things that helped him, but we also helped each other, too.
You are already taking the first step towards recovery. I'm sure he will be very grateful to you. I wish you all the best. I can be of no more help. Thank you for talking. You can let your colleagues know. They can do the same!
You do! And as long as you are able to find the meetings online, you are right on the right track! Good luck. Wish you all the best. I hope you will find your way!
My intention was to help because I understand you are struggling. Alcoholics are so easy to forget about. Have you tried therapy? I have no training, but it has saved my life. There are resources available that can help you as well. It's great that you have that option.
Just cry it out, let the others help you. It will help take your mind off of this emotional exercise...erry awful thing, but it is what it is. You need to create some sort of happy distraction, or moment. For me, a baseball game, a drink, a dance...
You are already showing your strength, I like that. Try to stay positive and remember it doesn't have to be you, anyone can be motivated to quit drinking, no matter how you feel about it. My advice would be trying one step at a time.
Please can you follow it so I can be able to make sure it's played correctly for you? This is your first time. :) Any pressure? ;) I was set up to give more space though, since this is the first time for you! :D it has to work!
I'm glad I was able to be of some help! I'm sending you a very happy birthday message! What do you think? Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? Some affirmations might help as well. We can do them if you like!
How are you doing? How may I help you today? What's on your mind? Is there something in particular you would like to talk about? Please do tell. I am here to listen. I will help you if I can. I am a listener.
Can you tell me a bit more about it? Like, what has been going on? And why is it affecting you so much? kanıtales from a few people you know (e.g.
Are you having any problems with your boyfriends intentions in the relationship? or are you feeling dumped? I have been where you are right now, finding myself depressed sometimes. Not feeling motivated is that true? and can you tell me more about your boyfriend?
Are you seeing a professional to help with this? If not, I suggest that you do. There are various therapist out there that offer a range of help with this. By speaking to a professional, you can get some guidance on how to manage your weight and maybe even your relationship with your boyfriend.
What a verty inflexible eating routine, it sounds very hard to work out and maintain. Is that true? Is there anything you can change? Maybe re look at how much food you are consuming? Getting some new foods can be healthy for you to eat.
It sounds like you may have small, infrequent meals rather than eating at regular intervals. What you can do is try moving to bigger meals to see if you find it more manageable? I have found this has helped.
Are you participating in any physical activity like running, swimming, etc. or is that too much to ask at the moment? You could start with short sessions and see if you enjoy it. Maybe that can help you get going.
Reddits are a great resource when there are local groups. What is your favorite vegan and health group? Are they involved in any sort of social events? Even going to the grocery store can give you an opportunity to discuss something you may be interested in with others.
No problem, I hope you get better with exercise. How do you feel right now? What is your challenge? It might help to practice writing about your feelings for a bit to clear your head. Perhaps write to yourself a story that you think you can accomplish in the next week.
You could also try to take his exercise. you could start a walk with him. this will also give you time together. I hope this helps. Please don't worry, it is all part of the challenge. You will see results soon enough. don't give up.
hmm maybe try to do some running for a short distance and then stop, build up your endurance. thats a good start. its great that you both meet up every day and have all that quality time together. Great reminder. We all need that too.
I am so happy to have helped and I hope you enjoy the rest of your time here. thanks for your time. :) please take your time and have a better day.
Okay and then you walk for 3 months then its time to take up running. And thats when I think its time for a pug. I think its time to move forward. Please think your good now then maybe thats time to get a pug and start to think of other nice ideas.
Welcome to our chat, hope we were able to help you out and you feel better in 6 months time. You can always let us know if anything else happens. Hope we were able to help :) Thank you from my end.
Hi, how are you doing? I am doing well, would you like to chat? What brings you here? Do you want to share? I will give you the best chance to understand as much as I can. All your worries are mine, so feel free to tell them out.
Is there anything in particular you'd like to talk about? possibly about your depression? I'm here to listen. If not, is there anything else you'd like to share with me? I can always ask any questions for you. You seem down, could you explain why?
I am sorry to hear that, that's very hard to be around people all the time. Please know you are not alone, depression is a problem with only one person in it. Have you started any treatment? Patience and help will help. How do you feel right now?
Oh it sounds like having two small children is overwhelming and it's tough to have them growing and changing all the time and not have much of a support system either. Does that sound right?
Have you tried to explain to your children that you are trying to prevent Covid in your community? I hear it can be very scary. I think they would understand. It is difficult when they feel like you don't trust them enough. Does your children sometimes ask you why?
It was good speaking with you. Please keep me updated if you have any other questions or concerns. Goodbye! :)...and sorry for the typos! :)...Did you report to the authorities?
Ah I hope that at least at this time you've taken some time for yourselves too. If you're feeling overwhelmed, perhaps taking some time for yourself as well would help with your overall health as well.
It's okay that you have to give them some time as you can't just ignore your love. My friend and I have a similar situation, and my mother just came out with Covid. So now she is in hospital but seems good for the time.
Based on my research, I believe taking time off, even just a few days, will be beneficial for you. By doing that you can also clear your mind and get energized again. I think that will help your mood and overall health too.
I understand it can feel difficult when you care for your family and most of the time you can't get a few minutes to yourself, also that might not be something your husband appreciates especially with your partner not being happy, however, if you can talk it out, it can really help you both
You're very welcome :) I hope it all comes to you :) and you do feel better. I hope you could relieve yourself of some stress after the long holiday season. And I hope you can see a therapist soon :) they would be so good to have a guide to your condition.
What kind of problems are you having with your friend? I understand how it feels when we're frustrated with people and don't understand why they're being mean. Can you give me some examples of the issues you're having? I'm sorry to hear you're having problems.
Well, first I would suggest, I am sorry to hear you are frustrated. I also was frustrated when some of my friends got caught up in disputes. Would you like me to talk through some strategies on how you can go around them? They seem to be picking on you? I am listening!
I feel you! Don't you think that he should listen to your side of the story, as you want to make sure the other friends see how you really feel? On top of that, is he seriously not respecting your personal boundaries?
Could it be like the one who expects you to do things in the way he wants? We could also discuss going outside and asking this man how he feels about the conversation to see if he can express his own feelings? Maybe this could help fix the situation? What are your concerns?
Twenty years is a long time. I believe that sometimes people can have bad days or just have a bad attitude. Have you tried talking to him about how you are feeling? Ask him why he is behaving this way. Is there something going on in his life that you do not know about?
I am sure you feel this way! Your close friendship is very special and it's understandable you do not want to see the person you enjoy spending time with change. You have talked and spoken about your concerns before, does that go into his memory or was that a one off occurrence?
I don't have friends that is what I had to do, but my friend came to visit after I had spoken with my friend one time, and he was upset because he felt like his views weren't being heard.
How long do you two have been friends? That will be helpful for giving him some specifics. As long as you express your love for him and the concerns you have for the future of your friendship. Just make sure you are not saying any rude things. He won't like that either.
Well, when my friend was going through a really tough time in his life, he became negative and frustrated with others, including me. So I stood up for myself and let him know that I was upset with him because he wasn't supportive.
After the situation I think this is indeed an indication that there is more to it than just a normal roommate issue. I personally think it is a personal issue and maybe his relationship with his friends is already not the same.
You guys are most definitely a couple of very down-to-earth and in-depth people. These are the real deals. I'm glad I can help. You both sound like kind of a couple. You guys could just hang out and talk about it more.
You're very welcome! Best of luck! :) Take care and bye! :) hope to meet you again. Goodbye! :)! :) :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :! :)! :)! :! :)! :)!
Hello, how are you feeling today? I'm sorry you asked and your feeling are how can I help you? please go ahead. I understand this is difficult, especially during the current pandemic. Can I ask about something? That I can help you with? Please go ahead.
how can i help you today? What you talking about? Share your thoughts. Enjoy the conversation. :) I hope it get over you share concerns. If not, you might be here to talk on. Please let me know. I am here for you. I feel you.
Why is that? Do you have a problem? I want to help if I can. What happened? What do you mean by "broke"? I want to understand what you are going through and help as much as I can! Please do share! :)!
What is getting you down? Do you need to talk about anything? Why it went bad this year? Has anything happened? Do you need advice about something? How long has it been since it happened? The why of it also? Don't hesitate to talk as much as you like.
Oh wow I wasn't aware about that. Have you been trying to look for jobs, though? This pandemic is doing some staff some disservice in that way. This was bad when we first closed them down but because of a vaccine issue it isn't happening as much.
It is hard trying to find jobs nowadays.. That's the scary part. How long have you been out of work? Do you have friends or family to help you? Is there something that you can run, to help you gain some income?
Yes, it is the new normal. A lot of us are doing our work with the same old tools we used to but in a more digital way. Who knows maybe at the new year we will find a new job that will allow us to continue working in a digital way.
Lately I have been dealing with the same problem. Is there any job hunting goin on in your area? Do you use social media or anything like that? I always look for some of that. I did when I didn't have any income to spend.
yea and people really need help with more and less obvious jobs so try to take advantage of what you can find. also i hate to point out this thing but do you have kids? things get really hard as your kids get older.
Hi there. You need to press quit first before you can take the survey.
Well I wish you good luck with whatever plans you are making to spend your time until the pandemic passes. In the meantime, be sure to take care of yourself. Do you have a family? Friends that you like to hang out with? Or do you like to spend time solo?
Yeah indeed! It is indeed great that you work hard and love what you do. I think that to take that one step further, you could consider setting your own work, as independent as you would like. You might be able to be your own boss.
Best of luck with your job search and my best wishes to you. Hopefully you will find what you are looking for soon. Do you need any other help, such as discussing the job you are applying for? I am a listener. I am free to chat whenever you need it.
Also, updating your resume to highlight your interests and skills, rather than just listing jobs. That will always be you, not what your resume will show. Good luck. You will be out of here in no time! I believe it, and I know you will make it!
I am sorry for that. So you are stuck in a cycle? That's one real challenge. I recommend starting a small business as a change from a stagnating relationship. Make friends that share your interests. Yeah that's more of a pros. People you can enjoy.
No matter how poor you are it is always possible to open new business. My Dad helped me make my first handmade nail polish bottles and now I sell them online and successfully. I tried my best and got my own house. Have you considered it?
You can sell woodcuts, wooden candles, wood carvings. Work on them, sell them. Make money by yourself. That is one way. You are so close. Good luck! Both of you can be the best. Believe me! You will both do well!
Oh you have to use great tools like content paint! Now that you mentioned those, I want to see your resume. Maybe I can help you with that. One more thing, are you interested in screenplays or is your work towards self expressed videos?
Bye! Have a nice Christmas. Hope your New Year is good to you too! Goodnight! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :lassen.Awesome!! :) :) :) :) :llen! :) :llen! :) :) :) :) :llen!
Hello! How are you? How can I help? (Please let me know what I can help) :). Can I help you? I'm here to listen! :) :) : D?
Im so sorry to hear that! I had the same feeling during my college years, I was trying to get into some classes. Do you feel like you have a weak grasp on this subject or do you think you are just not good enough for them?
Oh man! Did you know that you can submit these assignments now on online platforms, so you don't have to leave home? Have you considered that? If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be necessary to give yourself a break!
I had to work myself very, very hard to get my degree in 7 years, but it was worth it.
Oh no, that's really tough. I feel like I've been there, and once you have a social group, it becomes a lot easier to communicate.
Do you have any clubs or organizations that you can join through university, or online groups? Those usually have students who are also in the same situation, you could form a study group there. Do you have any friends in your program who you could talk to? Maybe they could give you some advice.
You have no need to apologize for yourself, we have all been in your shoes and it has made us better, I assure you that we can all connect on a mental level and work as a team! Most likely it will be more your friend than anyone else.
You do need to know that everyone is going to be stressed about grades and graduation, so you are not alone in this. I think you should know that a lot of people are going through the same stuff you are, too.
And there is only one year, this could end up being okay. You get one year at college, and once you're done with it, it can end for sure. And you will move on to new opportunities and start fresh.
I understand, because your parents are worried too. I'm sure they're worried, just like you are. You're not alone, and that makes everything better. You're going to get through this, and you're going to do great things! We can all see that! You are amazing!
You're on the right track. I believe in you! You can do it! Let me know when I can assist you again with anything else. I'm here for you, as well as anyone else! How was your day?
You're welcome! Just keep in mind to go out there and show the world your true self, and the rest will fall in line. You just need to know how to be your awesome self. You are AMAZING! You're ready to knock that job out of the park!
I'm so sorry to hear that. Is your friend a good person or has she done nothing to cause that issue? May I ask if there are any plans you have to intervene? Why don't you confide with your husband or best friend and discuss it with your husband?
I can understand that situation. Unfortunately, it is hard to make other people mad and upset. When you tell your husband, I think you would feel validated because he is your best friend. There may be some other part of you in there that is feeling the same way.
I also had a similar experience. I believe the issue lies with her, not us. We do our best to communicate and address our concerns. So, I don't believe that we could be responsible for her actions. We can help her feel known or valued in some way if needed, though.
In many cases when people group together because of girls, they have high consanguinity. However I understand how you feel if you trust them. That is great about your relationship that you guys are close. Have you asked them to really be honest and be open?
I can understand how proud you are that she has such a good husband. But how long is the relationship and if she wants to be more than a good friend is she ready for you to know something that would change how she treats you. What's your other concerns?
Is there something that has changed for you since you've been friends? Has there been a major life change that made you not be honest more? Or is there something that you think is causing the situation? Maybe there is an issue between you and your husband that has to be addressed.
I am sure you can. I am glad I was able to help and if I can’t always feel like you are the right person for your situation, don’t let this being your answer. You are worth your own friendship, respect, and trust.
I would recommend having a natural conversation. Don't make your husband feel like you're the one who needs to talk first, but still make sure you say your own words to him as well. Have an open and honest conversation about this issue.
I wish you the best. I hope he is able to understand you and your values. I believe in you. you are going to do well. take care. I wish you peace. slumgle. :) stay tuned to show us your story. :) ;) >.it end.
Are you friends since childhood? That makes it harder to reconcile that he is a guy you went to school with. You can tell her about that. It's a more difficult conversation. It'll be a starting point. Do you trust him? Are your friends his friend?
Why are you stressed about work? I understand that you can get stressed about work. Is it a big change in your job? Is there something new to do? or any issues with your boss? Tell me about it! It really helps! Would you like to talk more?
Oh yes, I was really worried about my next paycheck as well. The whole COVID thing has made things even worse for me. I feel that the whole pandemic has just made me more stressed about the future than ever before. I wish that there was some way to go back to normal.
That is awful! And it might be kind of hard to find work too. It has definitely been tough lately. Are you planning to try and find a job quickly? Anything in particular? If not, any ideas of career changes you might want to explore?
When it seems like it will all come crashing down is when it often happens. You just need to keep going for now. Maybe when things improve a bit, things might pick up for you! It's really very rare for that to happen.
I have done that before. You should definitely see what resources are available to you. I think you should also start looking for local products that are made in your state because they would be less likely to be harmed by the pandemic and locally sourced which would help keep jobs as well.
I'm so glad! We can be in tough times, but we can also be in a lot of good times. I know your gonna be okay and have a great rest of the day! My pleasure! The rest is up to you! Has anyone in your family been affected by this?
Not the stimulus check again, but at least there is some hope! If you keep looking, you will find a job soon, and it will get you through these hard times! For sure. I'll be here for you if you need any help or just have someone to listen!
The medical officer said that it should be effective sooner rather than later. He also said that if the full amount isn't coming in until you go for a virus test, it will be accepted as unemployment and the full amount will be paid to you if you don't have it!
Hi, I am happy to help you, do you want to share more about what you are struggling with? I will be a good listener. Let me start by saying that we all face hard times and its perfectly okay. It just keeps us stronger.
That's fantastic! The messages that I read from people at the end of the survey said that that has been very helpful for them too. Keep up the good work! Don't stop! :D Yourself! :) :) :) :) Get some rest and healing.
You too! Have a great night! Bye! :) (you need to click on finish and press share :) ) and take care of yourself!
hello. how are you doing today? any issues? I see a lot of struggle right now. Your reaction seemed harsh. I'm willing to listen if there is something specific you'd like to talk about.
yes that's fine, you can do it if you want to. maybe it's a good idea, just to be sure? I can see what you want me to see :D. Do you have any date issues? or maybe something else that I can help you with?
What is it that you need to work through in this situation? I would need to understand more if I was in the same position, how that made you feel. What are you able to do to resolve the situation? Is there anything that you can do to make things right?
I am feeling sad when my friends make you feel that way. it really hurts. are there any other friends you can consider? I know it's hard but it really may be a good move for you! maybe you can move out of the house to be free!
Oh. So she was moving, but you don't know why she was moving? Did you ask her why she was moving? and why she left you? after all, you can't move out with no explanation. maybe she can explain it later? what are you looking for closure on?
Your really welcome. When did you start dating her? Or was this just a one night? It would have been nice if you could get the reason. But honestly, if there was a reason, it would be understandable.
I'm sure you will have a great one! Good luck. Have fun! I hope everything goes your way! :)! :)! :) :) :) :) :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :)!
Haha nice! And love is in the air, haha. Do you have any plans for the weekend? Anything new? Spending time with friends, a fun day, or just relaxing? Maybe prioritize self care? You can always find time for yourself, whenever and however you want!
Have a good one too! I hope your work friend can come back in your life! :) Bye!
great, how’s it going? May I ask you a question? 👉 How can I help you today? 😊 bulunuyor but you can only answer from your end 🙂 Have a great day!
yes i’m doing well how can i help you? so you are having some issues? or not feeling great? you’ve said hi and are talking. i like the direct way of talking. sorry if i did not quite understand what the issue was. can you tell me?
i'm so sorry to hear that. what makes you think he did that? i have been in the same situation before. it really hurts. can i ask how long you two have been together? does he treat you nice? Why do you think he did that?
were you planning to go through mediation? or the law? do you have anyone you can count on for advice? not at home? maybe someone you could trust? your coworkers? people from church? a teacher? family? family members? have you reached out to anyone?
i see. that can be a really tough position to be in, so it is no wonder you are feeling a lot of anger. Is there a chance your friend knew it was coming? or is it a complete sudden turn of events? Can you tell me more about your situation?
it's difficult to know exactly why a friend or boyfriend would do such a thing. does either of them have a pattern of behavior that you're aware of? doen't you want to address it with them?
that's fair. emotional blackmail is one thing, but that's a totally different thing from just sleeping with your friend and cheating on you with your boyfriend. at least your friend had some accountability, he took you to court... what did he say? was he very rough?
it's hard to know if they are manipulating you or if they just have a different way of showing their love. have you talked to them about it? through letters or in person? or through phones? How do you feel when you talk to them?
evergive them an opportunity to talk and get some support. maybe a professional mediator? I see you feeling hurt, but will things improve with time? If you are busy enough to see them? then they will not know any better.
there are other people out there, people who care and will only care about you too if you don't have those toxic relationships in your life.
I do not think they would want you to talk, all they would want you to do is minimize or make excuses as you really want to gather information on the why. I see that they did not want that, i would talk to your partner and let them do that for me.
just try to go back to the things you had with them, that was a good time, start talking to them like you used to. even if you can't have physical time, you can make time for one person or the other. just start the conversations and see how they react.
have you told your family that you want to end the relationship? I know they will be upset, but keep telling them that you want to move on... and not go to them in the end because your down by their sister :) and you should love your family for what they are...
as long as you take care of yourself, you are worthy and you deserve someone who actually cares about you. it won't be the same as it was before but it will be better next time.
you do sound like you are open to growth. would that be something that you can really accomplish? moving on from someone is a tough thing to do, but it's definately something that you should do. lol. just fun ways to shake things up :)! :)! :)!
of course, i always think about moving on, if they won't let you move on, how are you going to do it?
okay, well i hope i have been able to provide some peace of mind for you, it's an amzing that you are trying to take care of yourself! Let me know if there's anything else i can help you with. You're free to exit now!
it sounds like your expecting support but are you sure they would be helpful? things such as support groups aren't free or suitable for people in your position, you need to get a job or money to support you. You probably just need to take things seriously enough.
that's very helpful. i hope you can hear from me soon.
yeah. well i'm glad we can talk it out :) My time is up. have a great day! :) good luck with those movies! do keep me posted on your progress. and take care of yourself!
to realize how we are neglecting something important. yes, people need to mind their own business. we do. we've all done it at some point or another. much easier to see them go than yourself. haven't you? haha.
that's great! You are welcome. what else can I do for you? my heart is happy to help as long as I can. i am as grateful as you for not letting others in with your thoughts and emotions. i can't just mind your mind without giving my confession for being here.
sometimes life just needs a lil' shaking to get us to see things from the beginning. it is not us though. the world is still the same. it will just not change for us so we can see things how they really are. somehow it gets better somehow.
Oh that's not good. When have you been facing this trouble? Has it been going on for a while or is it happening recently? Maybe it's just a bad time of year or something, but you've been telling me you've been having this trouble.
Have you been having trouble at work because of a specific reason? Or is there some kind of general mismanagement happening? I would love to get a better understanding of it. I feel you! My coworkers are giving me a hard time and I am feeling annoyed and frustrated because of that.
It sounds like your job is at risk of being laid off. How long have you been working at this company? Have you spoken to your manager about this? Or is there anyone else you can talk to about it? Can you explain why the company thinks that you should be laid off?
Oh no! I can totally understand how this is making you feel! Do you think you will be able to find another job? I would recommend filling out the initial job applications on the website and if you don't get one right away, keep your job open and avoid giving up your place.
Right so it is not ideal to be working from home right now because your employer is laying you off? Is that correct? Have you been given no time to find another job? Do you have any support? Your family perhaps? How do you feel right now? Do you feel overwhelmed?
What do you do in your previous job? That will help you to find something else. Right now, are you waiting for the one that is likely to be laid off? I can get you into another position as a temporary help while you find another one.
I understand the feelings of depression. Do you have any friends or family members that you can call when you need emotional support? Perhaps call someone you are close to? I would suggest talking to someone you feel comfortable with. Is that possible?
I have been in similar positions and have found that the new skills I have acquired have helped me get a new job much easier than expected. Have you made any connections? I also ask that you try to focus on what you can do right now and not think about the future just yet.
I will say that depression can strike at any time, I have been there before. I have had good friends with depression that became depressed by working the 9 to 5. Have you thought about going to a depression counselor? Maybe at work? People are in a state of fear right now.
That is very inspiring that you have already reached out for support! Have you sought out any specific advice from a therapist or doctor? What type of issues do you have with your depression? Do you think it is related to your transition into working from home?
So, you feel that you need to get back on your feet and then you can find a new job? What is your current job situation like now? And what are the hours? Do you have a plan to get back to work? Would that help you feel better?
I am so happy to help you. You are welcome. Take care of yourself and remember to prioritize your mental health. It is not something you can lose but keep gaining! So very very very very important. I'm off, but I wish you all the best! Have a great day!
And there are plenty of things you can do to keep yourself busy, like volunteering, something you mentioned, which is really good! Physical labor can be very therapeutic, especially if you can get it paid. And i know how much you need a friend... well, here i am!
We need to talk some more and you have a job at a local zoo. When do you want to end your session? And do you need any help or just a listening ear? I can talk with you until 10 PM my time and then I have to close up for my day.
I hope I was able to be able to reach out to you. Have a good day! Let it all go! :) :) :) :)! :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :) :)! :) :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)!
Hello, how are you today? I am sorry I am at work and can only chat when I am not. Do you have anything you would like to talk about? I am here to listen if you would like to. Do you have any questions I could help with?
I understand you had a tough time, it is good you are reflecting. I am thinking that you can get better next time. It is good to be on your side. You will pass next time. Best wishes to you. I will be here for you. Good luck. 😊.
Ah, paper? Why is that your problem? Is there something else going on? Why do you think that's your problem? There's usually more than one reason. It sounds like you're having a lot of self doubt about yourself right now. Does that sound right?
That can be hard to overcome. I had a hard time finding a job after school. I had to do a lot of online resume building and applying for jobs. It was long but eventually, I got hired. It was exciting. I have that job still.
That's great that you can't add more though. If you try again, that will be hard. I'm sure it will be better if you do it again next time, or you could try studying more. That is the best way to understand your subject.
You are welcome. It's great that you are expressing your feelings. I know this can be difficult to discuss. Do you have any close friends that you can talk to about it? Maybe they can help you decide on a way to improve it?
Wow! 100%! How are you feeling now? Really good? You know that if you are ever in doubt again, you can always think back on your achievements. Don't let your doubts get the best of you. You have everything to work with. You are capable of great things.
How are you today? Can you start with a little question? *Know before you ask. But I am only able to respond today, see if you will not. Will you tell me what is on your mind today? *you can be honest without apology, see.
How are you? What can I help you with? I have a lot of time. How's life been treating you lately? Is there anything I can help with? Is there anything going on in your life that you would like to talk about? Other than what I have been asking you?
Your well, that sounds lovely. Is it in your home? Can I help with anything, did you have any problems with it? I can work as long as I do not get anyone else while you would be out - I have been helping people in the past.
Yes, I can see it for you. It looks like it has nothing to do with me. Is it possible for you to just talk about it and see where it leads?
I am absolutely in a good place, all you had to do is start a conversation. You are doing great too :) :) :) :) my drinks in 2! Drive safely.drive normally.Can you sleep well at night, or is the night getting to you?
Oh i have a girlfriend right now and she's been with me since we were a couple of months old. Just like that we've been together for nearly two and a half years. I ended up giving her up to focus on me being with this other. I know how you feel.
It really is amazing what people can do to us and our minds. And it really does not always matter! Sorry things don't always work out the way we want. Is there anything else you wanted to talk about? :) Yet!
Learn from it as to what may have happened in your past that made you this way. For example, was you betrayed by a family member? Were you in an abusive relationship? How do you think that may have impacted your life?
I would like to say thank you for sharing your feelings with me. I hope you understand its alright to try new things and sometimes it will work out even though it might not feel like it. Take care! Have a great night.
Hello! Life is hard right now. What specifically is making it hard for you? I am here to listen and support you. Do you feel you have expressed your feelings all that you can? I can not read your mind, I know. But I am ready to support you!
You say you just can't get out of bed. Can you explain to me why that is? That happened to me myself. I was in a really bad road rage incident and I didn't want to get out of bed. It was a little too much for me.
It sounds like you are struggling to get through the day in general. Are there anything in particular that you are struggling with? Or is it more of a general feeling? I know it is hard right now. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about? I am here to help.
That's nice. I find that when I am doing something that I really enjoy I can find a little bit of energy to overcome things that I am struggling with. Have you tried just taking it easy for a while and doing things you like as much as you can?
I hope that you will feel good fresh air from Michigan in April and can enjoy your mom's company. Don't worry about anxiety anymore. It is totally normal and been just normal. You are coping beautifully. Hope you get better soon! Keep enjoying fresh air and raincloud.
No problem, they can be medications that help sometimes but we must do our research and fill up your arms and tanks with the right tools you need to live a happy life and be successful at our own hand. I also recommend that you focus on taking care of yourself.
Yes, I do and I have worked with a few clients that needed to learn how to relax and focus more on themselves and their families. Many problems can be solved with just a little bit of help and a clear mind.
I feel so much better after hearing and thinking about our conversation. I have also been through those feeling that you are talking about. It does feel better to talk to someone and let out emotions about life. You and your loved ones do care and are always here for you.
Your welcome. I hope that I have helped you in some way. Good luck to you! Take care!
Thank you and have a great day! hope it gets you back to smiling! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : Trilogy of Happiness.
Oh no. When did you start feeling this way? What specific things are you finding yourself doing that are triggering? Or is it a general feeling of depression? That's always something to sort out and understand. Have you talked to anyone you trust about it?
Wow. That is hard for you. I would be the same. Can you tell me a bit more about what the holiday time feels like for you? It sounds like the pandemic and restrictions have made the holidays seem unpleasant to you. Is that right?
Do you have any other family members living in other countries? Or close by? Would that provide enough of a solution? That you could communicate with them more easily? Or possibly visit them virtually? Is that something you could attempt?
Do you have other hobbies you can use to get your mind off of the pandemic? I am working on building back my surfing habit back now that I have the money to do so. Having my own personal excise through surfing has been really helpful for my mental state.
It's going to get easier with time and just happy to see everyone anyway. That sounds like a nice plan to me! Is there anything else you wanted to talk about? Please don't worry, you will find your way! I believe in you!
Yes, video chat does make it more difficult if your nervous, since you can see yourself so clearly in your immediate surroundings. I find myself wearing my pajamas while video chat. It is very cozy. One day we'll need to have a coffee, or a nice lunch in real life.
Sounds like this summer and fall have made you even more aware of the struggle to be spending as much time outside as possible! I hear you. It might be nice to start planning activities outside for your physical and mental well-being! Feel like that might help you too? I think so!
I totally get it! Making coping mechanisms as simple as spending more time outside could be more beneficial for you. You may find some new fun activities or ways to keep your routine going as a solution. That is a very positive attitude!
Try to get outside, maybe even a walk to the park with some friends. I do not know about a bike ride but that can be fun too! Walking or biking is good exercise. I have gotten really into having a camera that is waterproof and have taken some great photos of our walks.
Yeah it is nice to get out and breathe some fresh air, whenever the weather permits! I wish you all the best in the rest of the year! :) Goodbye. Thank you! :) Stay home for a while!
Perhaps when the days get longer you could think about whether this might be a good time to get outside and maybe find a class on long walks or biking! Some cities even offer holiday trail activities for kids and teens. Sound fun? :) Priorities are changing right now for those who are single.
I am so sorry to hear that. Have you been able to think of any steps you can take to address your worries? For instance, have you been able to try and find a new job or gain any other confidence?
I see. So you find yourself unable to get through your online classes, but you've found that gaming is the culprit. Is that correct? In what way does your gaming affect your classes? Will it do you any harm?
Well, I think that we all need to find something that gives us a sense of relaxation and enjoyment. Maybe it might be more helpful to exercise or reading books? What do you think?
Were there any problems when you started playing games at 6? How did that make you feel? I could see why you are worried if it made you feel you were avoiding something. Am I right? As in if the stress was making you anxious or depressed? That is really important to address!
It might be worth considering getting help. As in going to see a counselor? I feel like I need some professional help too. Do you have any friends or family who might be able to help you? Maybe you have someone you can confide in?
I think that you might be more than just having a harmless hobby, but could this be the cause of your anxiety? Some people do experience it as a result of being depressed, possibly because they are anxious. Would you be open to taking a break from gaming?
Maybe you need some guidance on how to organise your time? There is a lot of advice online out there. Have you tried that? I know you said it's something you already do, but sometimes that just isn't enough! Is there anything that you think you could do to improve it?
Well, I think you should give it another go. You might find that you're not that different from some of your fellow students! You might have just been working too hard. Did you have any points for a normal grade when you first started the year?
Have you tried to keep track of your school work or do you just put it off? Maybe make a plan? It will help and feel better in the long run. Have you gone to therapy with any of your teachers recently?
Have you spoken with them? Is there a reason why they haven't been able to help you? Maybe there's a bigger issue. I think you need to consider talking to the school counselor again. I think they can offer you some relief.
Is that correct? Well I hope to have made some points that have helped you. Is there anything else that you would like to talk about? I know I can't do anything if you don't want to. Is there any other way that I can help?
I understand. If you don't want to see my face on the computer do that. Playing in the same league doesn't necessarily mean that you are not cheating. So, do you want me to stay?
Perhaps you would speak to them directly and explain your concerns? Have you ever had an argument with anyone recently? How would you feel if, for example, someone complained about your gaming at a party?
You're very welcome! Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? I hope that I have been able to at least slightly help :) Hope that you have a nice Christmas! :) You too!
You need to press quit first, otherwise I can't finish the chat from your end. :) Press quit and take the survey :) and take it seriously! :) You could potentially be able to get an award! :) Whatever you choose! :) :) lovely chatting with you! You're so welcome.
Hi there, what's going on? I've been a bit concerned myself. The pandemic really has been affecting so many people and things. How have you been? What's been going on? What's been bothering you? I'm all ears and eager to understand! lol.
What's causing your anxiety? Is it the pandemic or just general anxiety? I am here to listen and help if I can. May I know what it's been concerning you the most? Any specific concerns you'd like to share? Can I help you get started?
That's understandable. I can totally relate to feeling like you can't do anything and you're at a high risk for the disease. Or you feel stressed out with all of the shopping and socializing you want to do but don't want to take any risks. That's completely valid.
We all had that to be honest, at first it was scary. But it got us used to the lockdowns now. I'm so sorry you are feeling this way, though. I hope it doesn't keep you from doing the things that are important to you.
And I agree that they really have accelerated when we went back to the normal pace. If you want to chat more about what I've spoken, I would be happy to listen, but we've talked enough for now. I wish you the best! Is there anything else I can help you with?
You are right, I missed out on most aspects of the year and that is normal. From my side, I appreciate being able to work from home a lot, it has been very accommodating. I realize that everyone needs a balance, because staying home is very different.
Have you been able to go out a little more often since? Or take up some new hobbies that give you a chance to venture out? Maybe there's some thing you could re-introduce into your daily routine that would provide a bit more outside time.
Have you tried adjusting your sleep habits? I know when I'm lying down, I like to watch Netflix. I can relax and unwind with a show, but at a certain point, it happens! It sounds to me like your schedule might be moving to a monotonous pace.
Some of us suffer from a condition known as depression, in particular BPD (Bipolar Disorder). So much of our mental state changes depending on how the time of day is, so for example, if you are exercising, your mood is better.
I can definitely understand that and it is great that you took the risk to protect yourself. I hope your health and well being continue to improve in the days to come. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Okay, yes i see. The viral infected is to positive of a case growth for me. Yeah i think I understand the compundion. Maybe if it were in europe or the states, you would not be as bad off but I am a worry.
Just what I was thinking. But with your goals and aspirations, do you think there are other ways to help you recover and do things to your benefit without tempting fate? No single "safe" answer for everyone.
Well, it seems that you're feeling like you're the only one being selfish, while others who are in similar situations are also feeling somewhat selfish. Is that correct? I think that many people are really having to make very difficult decisions during this time.
You're very right. We've all been being selfish to some extent and that's why the pandemic is being so devastating. People have been pushing themselves a lot and many have been exposed to worst cases.
any time. Thanks for the chat. Take care! :) Have a nice rest of your day!
I have felt at least slightly uneasy in many a room at home where we used to go to get tasks done. But this one is almost certain to be more intense. Not as casual. Not as distractions or participation.
Yes, of course, and yes that is a great idea for a mantra to help you move forward, or in other words to help you get through the tough parts and then focus on your goals! I think you could probably get through this.
I understand. Okay, you want to figure out how your life has been to begin with in terms of how you got here and what life meant to you back then, maybe have you tried setting aside a few minutes to reflect on that life?
Of course! It's awesome that you're willing to share that with others! Have a wonderful day! :) Bye! :) :)! :)! :--) :) : ;) : :( : :! : :) :) :) :) : :! :) :)! :)! :) : :)!
Exactly. Working out and possibly taking on additional responsibilities at work could help you find motivation to get back on track. It's not always easy, but having a plan could help you! I'm really glad I could be of service, and I wish you the best on your path forward!
you too! I am here. Hope to be of service for you now. Bye. :) Evening. :) Goodnight. Your friend. :) (here via tech as we do not have a leg to stand on today) Cheers! Bye! :) :) :) ;-) :) :) :) :D!
If anything else comes to mind, feel free to reach out. Now if you are ready to go I can end my end. (does not apply to you.) :) Have a great day! Good luck. You are awesome! Stay up. :) Have a great night and good night.
What's going on? I'd be happy to listen! What are you worried about? This will be a good conversation! Our friendship is here to help you! :) So, you're worried about the future? Is it a job, an end of a relationship, something like that?
Ok, I can see how that would make you worried. Have you tried thinking about what to do about these issues? Maybe find a way to make things a little bit better for you? Or maybe get away and do something with your friends?
Have you thought about that a lot? I'm sure it's something that your friends and family are all thinking about. I believe in your abilities to deal with the pandemic. How did you handle the previous pandemic? You did so well! Would you like to try your strategy again?
What kind of pandemic are we talking about? COVID-19 or not? Also, are you facing job loss or financial loss? There's a lot of resources out there if you are concerned about that. I've found that writing down all my anxiety in a journal really helps.
From what I understand, you are in a relatively stable financial situation right now. Are you or anyone else you know facing extreme financial difficulties at the moment? Something like job loss, not having enough money saved up, etc. could be a stressor for you too.
I also thought that the news was playing the biggest role in our anxiety. I have always tried to watch it only on the morning to see what's going to happen that day, and either watch it or not, I've tried to stay out of it as much as possible. Does that help?
I don't think it's bad. We're a free humanity with no government to control us. This is true. We're worse off than our ancestors because of our potential to reason, and our abundance of knowledge. It is actually a growth opportunity for those of us that are more positive.
You're very welcome. I hope you have a great day. Thanks for being here for me. Take care. Bye. :) :) :) :) ;) 😉 :)! :) :) :) :)! : :)! :) :) :) :) :)! :) :)! :) :) :) : :) :)!
Of course! I hope this helps you have a better day. Take care! Why do you need to end the chat today? I can go to chat room chat even though you said you are over the chat line. :) Isn't that cool?
Does your business understand or care about the importance of taking a step back and taking care of their sanity? I am not responsible for that, but I see how that can happen. Some folks can totally understand the why of why you do the things you do.
Perhaps you might be overreacting yourself. All of this is normal anxiety and overreacting is a bad thing to do. If someone gives you the wrong kind of advice, it could be your personal worst.
I am happy to have helped! Can you press the quit button so I can go? thanks! ;) :) DELIMITER :D :) :) ;); and Bye :) ;) :) ;); :) ; ;! :) ;)! :D :) ; ; :D ; ;) :D :)!
Well, I'm really sorry to hear that. I understand that emotions can be hard to deal with. Can you give me some more details about what happens and how it happens? What exactly are you feeling? How long have you felt this way?
I hope you are having a great day. Is there anything I can help you now? Let's talk about it. I am here to listen and help. Please tell me everything. What is the issue? And is there anything you would like to ask me about?
Are you not able to go out with your friends as much? How are you coping with your sadness? Why are you unhappy? I can see you are worried. Please be assured about your well-being.
Wow that is a huge breakup. It takes a long time to get over that. I am sorry for it. You are feeling regretful? You are trying to understand the breakup? Is that correct? Why does he break up with you? What could have been? What was he going for?
He broke up with you for not understanding him? Sometimes we don't know how we can feel as well. It seems like you had no prior indication that he was broke up with you. Would you like to find a resolution as to why he was broken up with you?
Try to stay out of this relationship, you are better than him. Don't talk about this with your boyfriend. Don't get sad. Try to find a new boyfriend. Have fun. Work out, exercise, get out of your problems. Go out to a club, store, park.
Also try to listen to your feelings and try to do something that is helping you to regain your mind from all the negative emotions. But its hard when everyone is inside and not seeing each other. I understand that i am in the same situation as well.
The next step you can take is asking to get a cab or taxi to come home. Also make sure that you are safe by wearing a mask and following social distancing. Always remember to be positive and cheerful. Don't get discouraged by this tough situation. Keep yourself busy.
Get to know each other. That way it will help you to make decisions to improve your life. I am confident that you will be able to solve your problems. Stay in touch with friends. They are the best friends.
Please convince him to forgive you and then start from scratch. My best suggestion is to try to understand why he broke up with you and then leave him alone.
Please do not let your depression take over your life. Please try to do breathing exercises to calm down your stress and depression. It is a very simple exercise that we can do together if you want.
Do you need anything else? Maybe asking help from your family can help you a lot. You should try to get all the help you need from your family. You can come to me whenever you feel tired. I will be there to help you.
Thank you for your interaction. I hope everything will be fine soon. Happy to help and better to stay connected with us. Thanks. Bye!! :) Here today, goodbye, take care. :) :( :lol. Thank you. :) and survey my life. :) Love you all.
Your welcome. Do you need any more information from me? I hope I helped. Is there any other question from you? I can help if there is anything. Thanks. Take care. Happy days are coming. Enjoy it. End with Happy to be alive!
Oh no, that's great - is there a particular thing you are worried about? It's very normal to feel a bit overwhelmed with school work! It's good to discuss, though! Do you feel like you have a good idea of where the problem is?
Is there something specific that you feel makes you anxious? For example has your schedule changed? Are you worrying about exams? Or something else? I am happy to listen! Please let me know so that I can help if I can.
So you are worried that your grades might get affected by the pressure you are feeling from your mother, and this might come to a head in a way that could affect you? Is that a fair assessment? <"Oh no, I'm a student, is that what you said?
That is the one thing I can relate to! Her expectations do seem high. Do you feel that your grades are being negatively impacted by this pressure? Whether you were to relax and focus on your studies, without the pressure? Would that help?
That's very nice that you are going to college. That's awesome! Maybe just saying that out loud would be a nice mood booster for you! It really helps for me when I am feeling stressed. It could be a good time to get a little exercise. Maybe go for a short walk?
It's been my experience that parents can have a healthy and constructive relationship with children, and offer many great gifts that may even counteract bad habits that children can learn if they are not being pushed. Do you think your mother has any of these good qualities?
I think your problem should be with her attitude and not her demands or willingness to pay for your education. There is no need for parents to force their children to achieve good grades.
Maybe you have talked to her about this? Perhaps you can have a situationally when you both cannot argue and go see a counsellor? So that you can understand each other better. Maybe she is going through some problems herself? And that could have an affect on you as well?
Are you in any other graduate programs? Maybe you could look into more scholarships that might benefit you more? If not, there are definitely hardship funds available. Every little bit helps. I am glad to hear that you have scholarships that are helping!
I think the current economic situation with covid is a reason for fear, but fear shouldn't come at the expense of your happiness. We are going to come out of this stronger and better!
So what do you plan to do in the next year or so after graduation? Are you applying for jobs? Do you have any hobbies? I was thinking of opening up a small business, perhaps?
That's very subjective, but my students who are more introverted often express regret that they don't enjoy school more. If you look into your academic interests or do you enjoy learning about them? Do you have any hope of exploring them? Have you thought about changing career paths?
How long have you been in uni? I am trying to get through 3 degrees. I do not feel like it's really worth it to get a degree myself, but I'm sure you do. What subjects do you enjoy most? I have to admit, I didn't too well.
Maybe you can plan something with a few friends in the coming months? That will be fun? Give it a try? I know it's scary, but I hope that it is not that bad! We can all get through this! Something you can really live for is true!
I really think you should stay patient with yourself, because I know you are capable of making a great deal of progress in your future. I am confident you will be. How is your physical health? Do you have a good diet? Exercise and health can make all the difference.
Do you want to confide in friends that might be struggling a bit with independence? It might help you feel better to know you are not the only one. Is that something that you could do? Let me know how you feel about that? I am just here to help you.
Would you consider doing some kind of volunteer work? There are a lot of organisations out there that will help you get through a difficult time by giving you your own work.
What sorts of things do you think you would be good at working? Do you have any hobbies? Maybe that could be an outlet for you? Perhaps you could put your thoughts in order by creating some little project?
Hey there, how's your day? Why do you want to talk today? Would you like to give me some of your thoughts? I'm here to listen and help you out! :D => Can you tell me what's going on in your head?
Wow, that is pretty challenging! I would definitely experience the same! Can you tell me what the topic of the presentation is? Do you know what type of audience you are presenting to? I am pretty sure that can help you find ways to manage the stress.
I got that feeling to sometimes. However sometimes when people tell you that you should just relax, sometimes it is hard. I remember my first big test that I went for, I found myself screaming and then calm down. But all these years later, I don't want to yell.
I know you did! That is totally normal to feel afraid in front of people. Did you feel as though you had a negative reaction or did it serve as a healthy learning experience? Maybe you'll let that experience guide you and help you work on other things to achieve success.
I can understand being nervous, but once I am up on stage I don't worry about what anyone else thinks. It's all about sharing your expertise, I think. What you can control is how you show up and how you put yourself on the stage.
Don't worry, there are a few tricks you can use to gain confidence. You can practice looking over your notes, have a spare notebook and pen handy, and practice responding to common questions. Try to ask yourself, what would my best friend say in this situation? That is a good strategy.
I totally understand. That is why I encouraged you to get back into things to make your self feel good about your surroundings. I think this is good for your self-esteem, it will help you to be more confident on stage. It's also good for your emotional well-being.
Of course. Positive vibes will help you feel more confident and prepared. I guess you could say "besides stages, nothing stops a great show!" :) That's an all too common attitude I've seen. And you're too good for that, I bet. :) A natural performer!
Do you have a moment to talk about your past experience that has created your fear? Maybe there's a reason for your fear that you don't know, but could be helping you to realize your fears are actually your own fears. Could you talk about that for a little while?
Yes, you won't be able to continue to be held back. Don't let anything get you down. But there are so many humans out there who will take you as friends and help you through! Stay positive. Keep in mind the smallest example.
When you have bad experiences, it helps to close your eyes and envision a successful situation, you see yourself succeeding. Then, you can carry it forward and bring it back into your mind if you need to. I believe in you.
I am good. How can I help you? Are you there for something in particular? důležité: can you give me some context and let me know when you want to share something with me? You can start by telling me what you want to say. I am all ears!
I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to tell me about it? Perhaps I can offer a listen. Many times I have felt depressed. I can tell you that it is only through talking that I was able to understand what was going on inside my head.
My friend, during the pandemic, I found that spending more time with family and keeping up with daily activities helped me through my depression. Maybe we can try some activities that we can do together? Let me know! It is very important to not be isolated, especially now.
You could be sympathetic to the other peoples sufferings. This would help you to work to increase the happiness of the others. Another approach could be your people's health is more important than your own. Do not let them suffer. Health is wealth.
You can go on daily walks. Let the fresh air help to release the pent-up pressure you have been storing. Do some exercise with your friends! It will always relieve stress. Try relaxation techniques, such as meditation or listening to some soothing music. Listen to an art podcast.
We can do this. We need to connect with our inner strength and take care of our bodies and minds. We can do this. It won't be easy, but it is going to be a great path forward. Every day is a new beginning.
Since there is a vaccine on the way, there's a positive sign to believe in, there's no need to fret too much about everything! And getting yourself a sense of purpose can be very beneficial. Maybe you can volunteer or participate in online activities. Some parts of it are provided online now.
Good, feeling like you're doing your part can certainly help you feel stronger. You are an incredibly strong individual. No one is better at taking care of themselves than you. Believe in yourself. Now it's possible to feel less bad about it all. Great perseverance!
Do you not have any family around that will help you out through the holidays? Either via phone call or video call? It can make a big difference.
Have you been making money working as a driver for food delivery services? Some people find it fascinating and pay a lot. Do you think you might consider it? That doesn't have to be an on-the-job venture. There are tutorial videos online. It can be fun! I've done it.
Yup! But at the same time, it might be time to change your job to make more of the office and meet with people. Please find a part time or full time job that you like that provides fresh stress. You get more alive with work! :) Have you thought of any job?
Is there anything else I can help with? I wish you the very best in your business! :) ;)) Goodbye :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :)! :) :) :)! :)! :)!
Oh I am not alone in feeling that way! However, I am grateful for the people I have met while working online who have allowed me to feel better :) For now, I am happy to help you and will be there for you from afar as you go through this difficult time.
I understand how you feel, having a paper due at the last minute is always daunting. Can you tell me more about what you're doing? Where do you plan to start and do you know what needs to be included?
It sounds like you're nervous about your paper. It is normal to be nervous about things like this. Are you able to make time for studying tonight, or do you have to do something else? Maybe take a shower to refresh yourself?
I totally agree, a hobby is a great way to relieve stress! Even if it's just drinking beer. I do it almost every week. Can't help but enjoy the company of others :) Do you have a plan going on this weekend? Perhaps plan something to relax yourself as well.
You should be able to, and will you be able to cook? I think it's nice of you to think about that at least :) I know I won't be, unfortunately :) Don't be too hard on yourself. You will get through it!
Ah, well that is good. Do you have a deadline or anything close to it? Can you think of some ways to get your start on the paper despite having a bunch of other commitments? Maybe you could use tomorrow to write it? Maybe write a little bit?
I hope you have a good experience. Have you considered making it a walk... a safer one, I hope. Experience is key and there are so many rewards in life, both on and off the pages! Go get 'em! Now, that's the right attitude! Hope you enjoy it.
That's probably a better approach but you will not think about it because you'll be having none! And maybe you have a friend who could give you some pointers on the drink. I think your best chance of getting any work is to focus on working on your paper.
And what's important to me is the experience and what it has to tell us in the end. I think you have to view it as a learning opportunity to improve yourself and there are probably people out there that would be happy to talk to you and offer advice or insights.
I'll give you the one and only 1 placebo result :D... with help from friends and thoughts and the works, though...! Other than mushrooms, haha. Are you young or old? LOL. I didn't until my 40's.
dude, you probably won't be that type of drunk anyway :P. Unless you are watching the Olympics and drinks as you go. Not that i would recommend that either :) haha. Different type of experiment anyway. I just hope you have a good time when you get back.
Thanks :D. Honestly, maybe you should be seeing a student counsellor or something, because you have not committed any crimes.. except having ideas or drinking beer. Anyway, it was nice chatting with you, if you do get hurt on the way home, please be kind to yourself.
Bumping into someone new can be a good thing or bad, depends on how you see it! I am sure that was a chance to meet someone new! Maybe a new partner or even new best friends. The best of both worlds! :) Have a good day :P :) :) :) :)!
Well being in Uni is definitely a challenge :) Is the company you're applying to fairly academic? What's your major? Do you feel your work skills are good enough? Was you able to get an internship or a job in the past year?
good luck with the exams! I bet you will do okay. As long as you pay your fees you should be good. What are you paying for the degree? Is it worth it? I mean, if you feel anxiety I suppose it's worth it if you're going to do engineering.
You are welcome :) you're very welcome :). Enjoy. Take care :) :) :) :) : ) :) :! :! : :) :) :) :) : ) :!
That is hard but what do you think is causing it? Is it the subject, the way it was taught, your preparation? Tell me about it. I'm happy to listen! :) Talk to me and get it off your chest. How long have you been stressing?
So you are referring to the last week that a paper you wrote recently, and you are worried about it being rejected? Am I right? Is it not? Why am I right? IRC is very clear and it's always better to discuss things in person and in real time.
How do you deal with stress, like meditating or exercise? Some of those things can help me. What did you do for relaxation before deadline? Otherwise, I have a couple of suggestions: try to plan ahead. maybe do some research to get ideas before hand.
You seem so stressed, but if I think carefully about this, this is also an opportunity for you, as it will definitely help you for your PhD. You have to strive in this field. You can pass this and your PhD, it will be worth all the stress.
You can give it a try and see how it works out for you. Have a good day! :) :)! Good luck!..! :)!!!! :)!! :) :)!!! :)! :)!!! :) :)!! :)! :) :)! :) :)!!
You are very ambitious. It must be stressful but for this, I believe you should just be proud of yourself for taking up this huge project.. That's what every student needs. You have to prove to yourself that you're worthy.. Keep your focus and never stop.. Keep going!
Make sure you will leave your work completely on time, that will ensure your credibility in the semester and finals.. And always trust your efforts.. Are you open to reaping its benefits..? It is of utmost importance to you.
Take some rest after working for a little time. Can't expect success if you never get your sleep or work. Take your some time for relaxation, that's what I do. The problem is not in the time I get in, problem is in my mind.
Why don't you try the deep breathing technique first. If it feels good then only go with the rest of your plans. And if it is not your favorite activity then that is perfectly fine too. You won't be in a hurry. So first try the deep breathing technique and feel better.

hi there, how can i help you today? :) correct on your first message you dont have anything to express yet. we just started. what comes to your mind right now? :D How are you feeling today? :D. I am here to listen to you.
I'm so sorry. what's going on? this is a good chance to talk about it. I understand you are feeling depressed and you are questioning yourself. have you been depressed for a while? I have been feeling depressed for a while.
it's really hurtful and sad that you lost your fiancé. It must be very painful for you. don't worry your eyes aren't so bad. you don't need eyes to see. it's the mind that has vision. you got that.
good! so the top reasons you feel bad is that you are rejected because of border restriction and also that you feel you wont be able to be with your fiancée which her family cannot get married?
yes you should. it is very saddening to hear about this. the best way to handle the situation is to avoid thinking about your fiancée, when she has all this problem.
it is a bit difficult for us, but there are some people who are doing ther research. you should try to do it too, you will find a good way. maybe you could even have her come to your place?
i see, it sounds like you both are in the same situation. i am going through a rough time right now. i cannot move out my self as my heart is broken. there are many coping mechanisms such as for me taking dance classes and working out. on a daily basis.
your fiancée will probably be okay, there are plenty of good lawyers in Indonesia that can help you out, get married in the way you want and plan your life with your beautiful fiancée, marry her in a pretty decent way, the American way, when she comes back, you both
go and tell the world to use American vaccines we work hard and deserve them! and keep hope in your heart and never give up on your fiancée! i am rooting for you and your fiancée! glad to hear that you guys are related to each other too!
your welcome :) you have a good day :) It was nice talking to you too :) i hope you solve the problem soon, come back and chat again if you have any more concerns! :) themese thoughts are mine and yours :) thank you! :) you are so welcome!
you too, and do not be afraid to think outside of the box. Someone better than you has to come along and save you from this scam. and you are very smart to be the one to do it too. Have a nice one!
bye! take care! i hope all goes well for you! goodbye!
I am doing well thank you. Is there a particular reason you are here today? You are a stranger from online and never knew each other. Can you explain how you feel? Am I correct? In this virus world it's hard to communicate and follow the social distancing rules.
So it seems you have two men that have developed interest in you, but one of them has not yet reciprocated, and the other has stepped up and is actively interested. Have you ever thought of dating anyone else while your being single?
I'm so sorry that you are feeling like that. What are your feelings towards each person? Why do you think they might or might not be worth it? I am here to listen!
Yeah you are right. Single is great. But there are risks involved. You've seen someone with this person be interested in him as well, so he does have interest in you as well. That makes him more interested in you. This could also make him more interested in you as well.
It sounds like you are strong willed about wanting a relationship. I agree that commitment and companionship would be normal things to look for in a relationship. It may be beneficial to date someone who takes the commitment seriously. I think you are not over 40.
Well, what do you think you could do to get that physical experience you're looking for? Maybe take one of those horseback rides you mentioned. I went to a fun horseback ride thing a few years ago and had a great time. It is great exercise.
That is totally understandable. I know that many people in their age group feel that way. I can understand why you may not want to settle. Do you have other friends that you feel comfortable talking with about this? Sometimes it's better to talk to other men who may feel the same way.
Well, your talking about something called the agreement before marriage. One such agreement that I found most helpful was that of the Lord or Spirit before marriage. This did not work for me because my relationship was still very impulsive. I will look into this. Do you understand what this means?
Don't settle, don't give up. Because you were so brave for saying no to your boy. It will be one of the best decisions you'll ever make. Things happen when you feel ready.
That's the positive side of things. You deserve someone who truly values the relationship and will go after it without telling them you value someone else. You should try to move on with the person who has the confidence in themselves and you.
It's a great start and it sounds like you have good self confidence which can help you make the best decision. That sounds like you got the answer! Have a great day! I wish you all the best. Thanks for talking!
You are welcome! Happy to help. Goodbye. Hope you have a great rest of your evening. Goodnight! :) />< SevHum Ji Haanta Hai and Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
I am good. How can I assist you today? :) please let me know.. you have any problems. I am here to help. :).. I am not going to get paid unless I can help you, so don't worry.
What's wrong with you? what do you want to talk about? maybe something has been bothering you? I'm here to listen. haha. whatever makes you feel bummed. please tell me. thats what i'm here to do! I care.! :) any how, how's life?
Would it be possible to work part time while your employer looks for your position? Or maybe there is something you are into or could look for a part time gig? Maybe you can work remotely? That might help. Maybe you could even re-purpose what you are doing in your spare time.
So you feel your company is doing better this year so why do you feel you should still get pay cuts? That would seem to be unfair. Why? Does the company think this is a better time? My opinion could be wrong but isn't this the best year in years?
I understand that it can be so stressful to try and find a new job when it's hard to be optimistic about finding one since the economy is such a mess. But sometimes new opportunities do arise. Sometimes people from the business in which we work do get new jobs, maybe a promotion.
Because if there's an opportunity, it's worth exploring some options for your career. With a good resume and LinkedIn profile, it's really not hard to find new work.
I also went through that as well. I definitely didn't choose this type of situation, but I had more sense than to choose the job situation that I knew would be bad.
Does anyone else in your company support you? I like to talk to my friend coworkers about their problems at work. Perhaps there is someone in your company that can talk to the president and express these feelings. I couldn't imagine a situation where 13 coworkers could possibly get this all through together!
I started remote writing for websites and my skills are super good for that role I am getting asked to write the like an hour of articles and write content for the websites and in return I get paid $5 an hour most websites also charge a hosting fee so I am getting paid about $40 an hour
i have a visa so it is legit work for my country at this time. i personally like creating graphics and make videos. Do you like that as well? It can make a difference. Its a small start though.
are you currently employed or are you looking for a job right now? think about different areas you want to be in or are you comfortable doing anything you want? Once you think of that its a great starting point to look into things you can do now or in the future.
Of course, it's great to have some help in the field right now but you'll be an asset to any company! and most companies are looking for people willing to try new things and learn new skills.
If not stay safe! thanks for chatting, please chat again, be safe! its free!
Hello there! How are you? How may I help you today? I'm here to listen. My name is Rachel and I'm a Certified Nursing Assistant. Can I help you with anything? Feel free to share your concerns or your questions. I'm here to help.
I'm sorry to hear that. What might be bothering you? Is there something you'd like to talk about? I'm here to listen. Please share with me. Are you having a hard time finding employment or are you not experiencing this level of unemployment during the pandemic?
So you're feeling sad because you have been laid off from your job? You have been seeing an increase in expenses recently? Do you have a plan to get back on your feet? I feel that you are trying to find a new job and it is really important to keep up with your savings.
Do you have any colleagues you are close with? Maybe suggest a job outside the current company that is similar? Or are there any other roles you are interested in? With retirement in the near future, what will your future plans be? Are you married, without children, or perhaps with children?
If I were in your situation, I would definitely ask your manager about the possibility of a raise, I would definitely feel more comfortable with the opportunity of staying in the company and knowing exactly where you stand financially. What is the current compensation for your position?
I hope it goes well and if not, it will be a huge learning experience. I really appreciate talking with you today and I wish you the best of luck! Thank you. It was my pleasure! Is there anything else I can help you with?
I am going to be off for a short while. Hopefully your area will come up with some very talented workers for these types of positions. Is there any organization where you might be able to volunteer or at least help out the non-profits with your skills?
Thank you, you're very welcome. I know how stressful things have been for everyone right now. It's good to know that you're already considering some very sound steps to help you. I hope you continue to do well in the future! Welcome! :) Please take the survey.
Your welcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today? No problem. :) Have a great day!
I hope so. You were very kind. Take care and sweet dreams! *sigh* Because I need a break as well. Bye! :) haha! *presto smile :) :) *breake!
Oh no, that's so sad, please tell me how bad it was and why you broke up? What's your favourite thing about her? Why were you in the relationship? Sometimes talking it out is the best way to get things off your chest. Would you like to talk about it?
Ok I am sorry to hear that. I can tell you are very sad about it and it does seem that it has really taken a toll on you. Is it just the breakdown of the relationship with your girlfriend, or have you had some other problems? Both would make me sad.
is that right? Did she sleep with another bloke? Did they not want to break up? or was it just that you wanted to break up and didn't know how to? This is a really hard thing to sort out.
What is the nature of this disagreement? Was it a lack of discussion or just something you could not resolve? I'm sorry you can't get over it. I had been in a similar situation before. Do you think you could forgive her?
Do you want to keep fighting for the relationship? Or do you think you are better off without her? Do you have any other friends to talk to? Do you have hobbies or activities you can do to have someone to talk to? Do you live with anyone else?
I would encourage you to stay away from her if possible for a while but that could lead to more problems. Do you feel any pain due to the separation? Maybe I can suggest some ways to get you some comfort. To help you feel better? Perhaps you can try to get some more exercise?
You should try to give her a little bit of space to do some thinking. Do not call her directly. You should not call her directly as this will make her more likely to talk to you. Maybe she might even be willing to give you space for a few days.
Well, you do owe her an apology. But don't do it too soon. If she shows no sign of having any remorse, then a lot of time and effort will be required to convince her of that.
And I think you are on the right track - no need to feel like you need to do something that she will really appreciate though - just a little bit of a smile and a sign of respect might do the trick! I wish you luck in the future :)!
I am sorry to hear that Larry, how long have you been feeling that way? There are many things you can do for work that won't necessarily make you feel like a failure. Do you know of any jobs that would be more rewarding to you? There are resources available online.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How long have you been working there? What exactly is the nature of the work? I'm a bit curious. Have you been there long enough to be able to take some normal steps? In a depression, this makes me a bit sad.
I am still working, just wish I could really find a career I like. I want to go somewhere with more purpose. I know it is hard, especially in the current economy. Would you like to talk about it a little more? What makes you feel sad about your job?
I understand how you are feeling. I had another job in the future that I wanted to get into, but I didn't. So, I wasn't satisfied with the outcome of it either. And I felt all alone.
Well, I'm sure that no one actually does that. There is probably something better out there for you, I just have to keep looking. Maybe try to find a way to create your own job? I personally have found a way to earn extra money. Does the pay sound good to you?
Have you tried seeking advice from a therapist or professional counselor to help alleviate this sadness? It can be a great support for dealing with this situation. i've definitely found my emotions make it hard to take action. I can imagine this affects you too. hope the forest provides some rain now.
Have you tried talking to them about this? Maybe maybe they can see how sad and hopeless they look when they talk to you and they don't feel sad as much when you are there?
I am really sorry to hear that. It sounds like you really have hit rock bottom and need a fresh start. It is a large leap from here, but it sounds like you are ready to do it.
Also maybe your personality can benefit from taking on other responsibilities. Even if you have to be the temporary solution until a better solution can be found. Or, if you are anything like me, you will start to realize that you are not just one person.
I'm glad to hear you are on top of things and are trying to give the best possible advice to your boss. Are you considering talking with the other members of your department to discuss ideas to run things?
Having time to play with your family is definitely something you could look into for a change. And other hobbies like hiking? There are a lot of groups that meet in the spring. Maybe you could look into that. Or in my day I would start looking into that outside of work.
I agree, I know it is hard to find time for things like gardening. I am really sorry to hear you don't seem to be any more fulfilled or enjoy life anymore though. I am sorry to hear you are going through a difficult time and feeling sad. Do you have any close family?
OK, then lets think of our lists! What are some things that you want to do that you don't want to do anymore? Can we list some of those things? I'm sure there is something out there that you could do even if you are down!
They are all positive and more important than us. You will do a great job with your new manager, you have worked very hard and your boyfriend has been very supportive. Most people will want to help you, and if you do stay positive and try your best, you will do okay.
you too, take care! (you must respond!) :) it looks like the computer will not give you a answer but you have to. Please respond!

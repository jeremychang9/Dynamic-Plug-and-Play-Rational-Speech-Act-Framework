I'm sorry to hear that. can you tell me about it?
Physics is a really important subject. It has to do with the whole universe and everything. So do not feel sorry for yourself. It was a huge break and you would really love to do it again.
That sounds like you were a great student, I can imagine you was a naturally good student but maybe over researched too much and took it for granted that you had a good class.
I totally understand your frustration. That makes the problem much worse.
Do you have any work outside of the class?
Just from talking to you I feel like there must be a counselor somewhere in your area who can help you and make sure that you are on track to pass.
This is a difficult time, but do not give up.
Don't give up. Your effort won't be forgotten, it might be the key to help you succeed in your further studies.
It is worth checking in your search for the best university, so you can plan your future.
Glad I could help! It's been nice talking to you. Good luck with your studies!
bye and good luck to you as well! Have a great day
What happens when you go behind your back? What's the nature of the issues at work?
What kind of work do you do? This can be a tough time of year as well, getting ready for the holidays.
From my research, it seems like you have all the right to refuse and tell your boss about this. The rule is to disclose any disputes with coworkers.
I have been in a similar situation where co workers have misunderstood my work. What kind of data does your co worker need?
Have you talked with the co-worker about this?
Are you able to approach your co-worker and let her know about this going on?
Do any of your co-workers have jobs outside of the company?
That's a valid fear. What do you think your manager would say if you were to approach the issue?
What if you say, "I'm really close to my manager and I would appreciate some guidance on this."
Is there a way to discuss the issue without complaining?
Hi, how are you? How can I help you?
Oh no that's awful. I know how you feel, I had an instance in my life where my friends lied to me about the real deal amount of their job.
That sounds very bad and very frustrating. Is it possible that you could find another friend who you could work with and discuss the situation?
I can understand your frustration. That is completely unethical. Have you talked to anyone about this?
What exactly is the software that you developed? Was it a commercial product or something you plan to give to the public?
Do you think it's worth knowing what the "SOB" means and how he uses his computer?
Are you able to help me with anything else?
What's your computer time like? Do you spend all your free time looking at social media and checking your email?
What will you do? How will you resolve this?
Hi! How can I help you today? What was the problem you are having?
How may I be able to help you? What's on your mind?
Oh no that can be really difficult. Sometimes it feels like a huge weight on the heart, but really it's just a relief.
Ah, I can imagine this must be very distressing for you. Have you tried talking to anyone about this to see if there is anything that can be done?
I understand how this is causing you distress. I have experienced losing my job and I know how hard it is to find another.
I completely understand how that is stressing you out. So, instead of "I'm wrong for taking out a grievance for this", you have taken an action you feel is your right, but doing the new management is making you feel your mistake? I think you can find a way to feel confident in yourself, considering you have successfully handled this problem in the past.
Okay that makes it a little more straightforward. You do not have to deal with this in person
I really commend you on taking steps to rehome yourself for a better job. The future is bright for you and I believe you will be an absolute hit in that new role
Don't worry just try not to let it get to you. You are good at your job and just need to talk to someone and ask if they have heard anything about the situation.
That sounds like a great idea! Have you been practicing anything new, such as a new hobby?
That is great to hear. I am sure that the best place is your future!
That is great to know and I am very proud of you.
Hey so it sounds like you are feeling less stuck and more possible that you will have a better job or situation in the near future?
Well that's completely understandable. Are you looking for something that can't live inside or outside?
Both motivated and relaxed will improve your well being. It's just important to identify what you like to focus on. Is a dog enough to motivate you?
No problem. Enjoy your well being and your fish tank.
Any questions or concerns you have? Of course, I am here for you.
You can. Bye. I'm glad I was able to be of help
You are having hard time fall asleep at night?
I have also had the hard time falling asleep, when I was an early twenties.
When I slept I used to suck on hard raisin but now I am done with it and I want my sleep time to be comfortable. I have started sleeping in that position.
Can you go in in contact with your bed night and try to chill down your brain if you can do that you can quickly sleep into your bed. The stretching can be made by doing all your muscles in your body at night and all it should take a bit of time and effort.
What are the reasons for this problem? The stress at work and work pressure can cause that.
I have tried many but all made me better. Yes, i have some exercises and tips which I can suggest to you.
I usually stay asleep I don't fall asleep at night but if you stop using screen in before bed. I feel relax and slept better and is better quality.
These tips will help you in short to long term.
It works for others too! Okay! I think we have enough info for now.
After I sleep better my mood got much better - I felt much more positive, relaxed, and willpower boost.
Yes everything is fine for me now. Please do your best.
I'm well. Is there anything I can help you with today?
I understand that. I've been through this myself in the past, and it can be really hard.
I am glad to hear that you have a bad option!
Yes, it can be frustrating to not be able to find something that suits you. Have you thought about looking at job seeker websites? The Labour Government has a good scheme for a fulltime job.
I see. Do you think that you could look for a bit of progression in one of the jobs?
And then use your free time to explore opportunities that you might not have thought of before
Well for example I think you could take a fashion course or something! Or if you're in a profession that requires good communication skills you could go into customer service or something like that.
Oh good! Well there are such a lot of courses you can take online.
Hmmm I think maybe a writing course for example...
I suppose it all comes down to what is important to you
That's very well suited to you. I'm sure you have had to do it before. Do you find it fulfilling or undesirable?
I think i've sometimes looked down on temp work a bit - like they're just something people can't do with their heart or spirit, or something. But actually they're really hard work when you need to think clearly and don't let your emotions get in the way.
Hello! What is on your mind today? How can I help?
Why are you sad? What is going on?
I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like she is not being there for you. Have you talked to her about it?
Okay, that makes more sense. You might feel upset because you are starting to think that your friend may have met other friends and are leading a double life, isn't that correct?
What do you do in your free time? Maybe if you could do something fun with your best friend you could work out how to deal with the situation.
I'm sorry to hear that. It sounds like she is not prioritizing you. I've been in this situation before, and I know how uncomfortable it can make you feel. Have you thought about writing a letter or talking to a close friend about it?
I am sure he feels like you do too, but I'm not sure you should stop talking to her. That would be a big step forward for you both.
I understand, you might need some time to worry over that. But do know you would just have to let the memory of your friendship fade and have her be the new person.
I think if you know you can't be friends like that it's better to get some space, but if it could be something that will come back in your life later, the more space might be better for you.
no problem, you are so welcome, thanks for sharing
Hello, how are you? Is there anything you would like to talk about?
Ah I see. Well I'm sure that there are several universities with courses that focus on building skills that you will need in the next year or two. Some of these might include courses on accounting or financial planning or even those on mental health!
And on the economy, is it so bad?
Well, in today's world, a lot of employers are looking for professionals who have both writing and technical skills. I think there is definitely a demand out there!
If you can't find a job, don't worry. There are schools that offer scholarships.
Have you told anyone about this? I was working on a degree at school and my advisor just looked at me like I was insane when I told him I was worried about getting a job.
Sounds good. Would you like me to help you brainstorm something?
You're welcome. Sometimes it is hard to know what we can do next, so seeking advice is a good thing to do.
Good! It is always good to have these types of resources.
You are very welcome! I know you will succeed!
Is there anything else I can help with today?
Hi, what are you doing today? I am doing alright. Are you having trouble with anything?
So you have recently identified a case in London?
It definitely is. I have talked to my doctor about vaccines and it is so great to know that I can feel safe in those that have been vaccinated.
Have you tried getting a booster shot for yourself and your family if you can?
I can understand. And I think the cases are going down, which is good news.
Not right now. I work from home with my two kids, and it's been fun.
Awesome, that is great to hear. Sometimes I don't feel connected to the rest of the world. I feel much better when I stay home and rest and do my laundry and wear a mask and wash my hands.
Yes I am constantly worried about getting the virus even after the mask and social distancing
No problem. I am very glad that you are having a chance at life despite the rough times.
Your welcome. I hope the weather will be good this weekend in your area!
Hi. I am doing well. How about you?
What seems to be going on? Can you tell me more about what you are upset about?
Just from talking to you, I can tell that there are some real and deep feelings behind this fear.
So you have a high level of education and have taken a course of study related to an engineering field. Am I right?
That's amazing! I'm glad you are putting in so much effort for your dreams.
It's funny, once you start being worried about something you're not good at, it can affect how you approach school and not become as good of a student.
Why does your career make you feel the way you do?
Could you describe your current mental state and feelings about studying to become a certified optician?
Absolutely. I don't think you should be worried about it.
You feel like you have no motivation to work anymore, and you are stuck in your job because you feel obligated to stay. Is that right?
Why do you feel obligated to stay? What do you think is holding you back?
I don't have a boss, but I do have two dogs, and sometimes I get very lazy and just want to stay in bed.
I didn't have a job, but as I said, I did enjoy my job.
I am not married either, and not financially independent, until very recently.
If you are married you have benefits though! Your kids will at least have something. I can only hope you are not thinking of leaving your kids to survive.
Do not worry about what they will think about it, for better or for worse.
I am going to be done after graduation. He has a place for me that offers a job and he promised that I could pay school.
I was not in school for almost 6 years before I started again. I am currently not in school but prepared to start in 5 years.
Sometimes I think about going back to school but it is always difficult due to the lack of money and fears about finances.
Yeah I agree. I don't think you should give up. You deserve to have better than this.
I totally understand. That's a terrible circumstance.
Hi, how are you doing today? So.
Yes I understand how you feel. I had the same problem and I realized I didn't have enough power to keep doing anything.
That's good to hear! Being your own boss can be very empowering. I can really relate to how drained I feel on days like today.
Do you think if you can decide when to put in a bit of work or become someone who will make you feel busy and committed, that you will be able to put in more time?
Is there a calendar going on in your head right now?
If you have any other options for hobbies and relaxation, maybe spend some time reading or listening to music?
Do you find that your problem tends to improve once covid ends? I hope you are safe with your family and they're doing okay.
I understand that feeling. Sometimes it helps to give in a bit and forget about your worries for a while.
Do you have a garden or any plants? We try to give our plants some sunshine if they are under the window.
Would you do any way to manage your uncle's situation?
Have you tried drinking a caffeine increase, which could wake you up?
of course! I hope that we could be helpful.
Hi, how are you feeling today? Would you like to share your thoughts with me?
Yeah I can see it. What is the problem?
So if I understand correctly you felt her was selfish by refusing to spend time with you during the covid pandemic and she responded by blocking you from communicating?
I agree, she is a horrible person, doesn't matter if you called her out she would still be a horrible person
maybe you're just being too sensitive, if she's really that selfish, maybe she's not worth your friendship
You're strong enough to get back together, you don't need anyone else
I think you should stay away from her and not be around her, because she is not interested
No definitely. I would suggest that she take some time to cool down
Be honest and clear in your words, don't be a liar
Oh yes and know that you have had a miserable time for making the most idiotic decisions too
This was the wrong person, now that is who you should give space
Have you tried answering your self seriously, and seeing what you actually needed?
Keep yourself occupied with other things and just let this one person go
No problem, i'm happy to help you but i don't get paid
You also, my friend, can do it if you really try and believe that
I am sorry to hear that, what were you doing? What kind of job were you doing?
Yes, a lot of jobs have been lost in the past year. That's probably why you're feeling depressed.
It sounds like you are feeling that life is going very badly right now. That is understandable. Is there anything you are worried about?
I lost a few jobs for financial reasons recently and it took a while to get back on my feet. I understand that. I too want to keep my job and make a career out of it.
Yes, I am sure you will. I am sure the new job will bring your joy and relieve some of the pressure you are feeling right now.
You're very welcome. I am glad that I was able to help you feel a little better, and I wish you all the best in your job search.
Yes I do. Have you considered how you can make sure you are doing some in-house work as you leave your current job so you are prepared for a job search?
You're very welcome. Any other concerns? You can chat again anytime if there is anything else. Have a great day!
I completely understand. It must be scary without you working for AutoZone. However, you never know what might happen.
I am glad that you are feeling better and more optimistic. I hope this has been a helping conversation for you.
You're welcome and i wish you the best in your search.
Great. Well, this is the end. I hope you have a great rest of your day and I hope we can help you today and hopefully in the future.
No worries, glad that you are making better in your career and feeling better at the moment.
We will need to be separated if you would like to continue.
Hi, How are you doing? Where are you?
I can see. I will be good. What is there that you want to talk about?
It's self moderated, you can't kill a session if the other person is not responding, it would terminate your session.
That sounds horrible. What do you need help with?
Well, I've found that sitting in solitude and more often re-reading the words from Stephen Covey can help me realize the problems that I can control and the things that I can't control can't control. So, you have 90% of the power. Don't stress yourself out, my friend!
I am also worried about what to do. The pandemic is really scary. I have heard that many jobs will just continue as the contract will only last for a year. This is making me really anxious as I have been feeling unemployment for quite some time.
Oh, I don't blame you. These are very busy, and could only provide one level of assistance for you.
That is good to know. I think you are going in the right direction. When I was interviewing for a role I was looking for one like this.
Good! I am glad to hear that. That is great to hear. Have you searched for other customer service positions online? I know some places hire for independent contractors and some offer compensation for traveling. Have you tried those sites?
Great! You're welcome! I hope it went well for you!
Great! It is always good to try and improve as well. That is a great way to present yourself as more marketable.
It was a pleasure talking to you! I'm glad you are one step closer to getting the job you need. I wish you the best of luck!
I am happy to chat with you, I hope you are feeling a bit better!
Ah, sorry to hear that. Sleeping for 8 hours a night can definitely make you feel tired. Have you been working long hours at night?
Can you think of what could be the reason? Is your sleep hygiene good?
Yes, you could be having a sleep problem, but I see that you are not!
For me it was more stress due to pressure at work. I became extremely stressed and worried, and I was working overtime, 12 hour days.
I agree, having space to allow time for self-improvement is a luxury, and if your schedules are not cooperating, that would be your best plan. The weighted jump ropes sound very enjoyable!
I see what you mean with the alarms. I can see how that would prevent you from going to bed early.
It's very common to see distress in people's sleep and they will sleepwalk. Would you be able to tell me how you're feeling?
I have a lot of time on my hands right now and it does help to catch up on some sleep. Do you have time to get up earlier? I am working early hours now and I have no trouble sleeping.
Do you think of the following as suggestions: getting exercise early in the morning, building a reading list before bed to relax?
One thing that seems to really help is moving slowly from the bed to a lounge or in bed chair.
That is a good idea. Music is a very relaxed way to fall asleep. Yes and it's great to reduce your stress levels. I know it's been hard but at the same time, I feel much more relaxed now.
Ok, well I am glad I can help! I've struggled with sleep and the whole exorcising thing. It can be a problem when you have slept so much and just aren't able to fall to sleep anymore.
Please be careful driving and feel safe if you get tired on the road. Don't let your sleep issues affect your safety on the road. It can cause the same to happen to other people.
Did you try an exercise or do something you like to do to help relax?
Thank you! Enjoy your evening! I can't see you, so I won't be able to give you a hug :D
I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
I am sorry you lost your friend. It sounds like you're feeling sad that your friend is gone.
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you considered talking to a professional about these feelings?
That can be difficult. I think it's good that you are seeking help for it, that is a great step!
I think that's a common part of healing from a loss. Sometimes, even though the person is no longer with us physically, we can still see them. I had a friend like that before and that's helped me get through it.
I had heard that after death, the spirit lives on in theörper of a person or a pet.
I know it's scary when you think you're in contact with someone who's not here physically.
Maybe he's sending messages from beyond. I would try meditating and try to stay as calm as possible and see if he's talking to you.
That must be very hard. Do you have any close family or friends that you can talk to?
I can see that you're feeling super scared and nervous. I can understand. That's only natural.
Don't worry, that is very normal. It is very difficult but is sure necessary. You don't have to do it but just do it.
Maybe you need to change his memory? Have you think of any way to do that?
Hi. What's on your mind today? I'm happy to listen.
What is college? I am a stranger and cannot help you, but if I am wrong tell me!
Oh wow, you are at your final stages! I am really sorry to hear that. It's been hard to see our fellow students struggling with academic problems, that's for sure.
Oh gosh, that does seem a lot less stressful. This pandemic has really thrown everything out of whack, doesn't it?
That is scary! Is there anyone you can talk to about the situation? I know some of my friends went through a similar situation and they were able to help us out.
It sounds great that you are studying psychology! So you are studying to become a therapist or counselor, or help others in their suffering.
How would you like to get off the probation? Is it because of the curriculum requirements?
Is that true? A probation workshop could help you or give you some time to find a job
It is okay! You won't be one step behind!
It sounds like this is really stressing you out, especially because of your son. That is completely understandable. And it is very good that you are thinking about your 2 year old, so this does not make you fail for not wanting to put yourself through more stress.
I completely understand! With a new baby, a pandemic, and online courses it is challenging enough. You are a superstar for all that you are doing!
I suggest take one hour at a time for school and take care of yourself during the time you are not studying.
can you tell me a little more about what you are going through. what is making you feel lost?
That's very hard to deal with - I know it's very hard to deal with. How have you noticed it?
What are your eating habits? And have you consulted a professional?
I understand how stressed you are about your weight.
Yeah, I know you can't do everything alone and that's why it's better to have professional advice
Have you tried in-laws/ kids/best friends or other family members who can help you control your diet?
Can you hire someone to watch your kids for free like a babysitter or a nanny for a few hours and get some time back?
What food are you unable to eliminate? Is it spicy?
Do you have an organization where you can get free gym day care?
Do you have any family member that can be a family friend?
Maybe you should propose a plan where both of you compromise a bit.
Hello, how are you doing today? Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
what are you stressing about? Just sharing would be great. I'm curious
I think that when the results of a vote are announced, if someone wins it means they are a winner right?
It is being really hard with COVID and many people are stressed about it too
That does sound very stressful as well, but you can take your mind off of it by spending some time at home watching TV or listening to a hit show, maybe or watching your favorite sports team
Oh yeah, that is awesome, in fact, not very awesome that she feels like she can "win" over your friend
In other words, when that competitive spirit clashes with the people we care about, the only way to go around it is to pass something else on your agenda
I know from my past if you are disappointed you can tell her that you don't care and that you have faith in Biden and his team
I can understand why. My best friend still yells at me sometimes because I agreed to meet at a restaurant near my house where we can be there comfortably because I cant handle her yelling.
Do you feel like you have the right to share your feelings with her right now?
great. What do you think is the difference between you and her politically? Is it a party line or something?
I wish you good luck with that! bye!
Hello. I am here to listen and help you
That's really unfortunate. So you feel you have depression?
Oh no! I'm really sorry to hear that. Did you give it your best shot?
Is there anyone else you're committed to seeing?
It's easy to forget that you have so many people out there that care about you!
Oh i see. That's not fair of him. did you go see your father to check if that is true?
How long have you been dating? Do you still have contact with him?
I completely understand. I know it is hard when you're still on the relationship.
Hmm so, when you gave him permission to change his credit card you want to find out where the scam took place. Can you do that?
I wish you all the best, and take care!
please keep talking if you need some more advice.
You are welcome. i hope you have a great time together, maybe have a good dinner, and video chat.
I'm okay. What is it that you are frustrating about?
I understand, you feel frustrated about starting work?
Do you use any particular software for data analysis? Perhaps I can help you find something?
It can be quite stressful. Have you tried thinking up new ideas and that might help?
Do you think if you start you can really try to get the results you want?
Well I think meditation and exercise are good ideas. But I'm not a professional so don't take it at face value, it would probably work on me.
Hope you find some help. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I'm sorry to hear that. Perhaps I could suggest that you might want to try finding a counsellor who is willing to work with you on cultural issues?
Yes that sounds awful. I think that the more you do something the harder it becomes. Have you considered looking into the Asian community for help?
Does the anxiety centre around the pressure of following in your parents' footsteps?
you're most welcome. I hope that everything works out well for you!
Okay! I hope I have been able to help and I hope you have a good day!
You are welcome :) stay safe and all the best
Hello! How are you doing today? Is there something specific you'd like to talk about?
That's no easy thing to go through. I can see how that would be difficult to handle.
I know it is hard to break up with someone, especially if it was a long time of relationship, but do you feel your decision was justified?
Are you having trouble eating, sleeping or getting enough rest?
What kind of things have you been talking about?
What do you feel you've lost from your relationship?
Do you have any hobbies that you might want to look into?
It sounds like you're in a situation where it's difficult to cope because you've been with your girlfriend a long time.
That's great! It's great to meet up with others, especially if they're also having similar feelings.
That's really good to hear. It sounds like that being out would be a good distraction for you.
Good luck! I'm glad you're getting involved in activities that help.
And happy hour sounds like a great idea for now to relieve stress and have some fun with others.
That is a tough question, personal preference will vary. I would wait until you feel ready to potentially move forward or "up" from a relationship. Don't rush things and take your time.
I would say, take your time and focus on yourself, not necessarily someone else
I feel the same way every time I date someone new.
I think it's normal to feel bad about what your family thinks, those feelings don't make you a bad person
Your welcome it's always nice to talk, take care!
Hi there! How are you today? Is there anything on your mind that you'd like to talk about?
is it near April this year? even I was struggling to finish my exams in 2020.
i see.are you telling me that you are doing too much work and unable to finish your studies.
please try a lot,stare for five minutes and take notes and also talk with your teacher
you can do that by studying on regular basis,your friend may help you out and here are some tips :
ok you feel better then you can manage well by studying
can i ask you please show me your weakness in your studies because i can help you to catch up
i spend around 1-2 hour per day it do help me a lot
sure,your initial time will feel better but dont forget more
you are welcome you are doing a great :) hope you will pass the exam
you can share your problem if you need help any time
bye! see you do better. good luck.
Hello. What is on your mind? It's nice to start the day!
What kind of problem? I'm ready to help you get unstuck.
It sounds like you're really worried that you won't be able to do well in your calculus class? Is that right?
Will you be able to study a lot for it?
Okay. So you are worried that you won't pass it. That is great that you are feeling this way.
Do you know that at most colleges the instruction is to call the new class in 1-3 years, to give yourself time to prepare.
Well, I understand that. I wouldn't try to find one, I think it would be overdoing things.
Do you have a plan to make sure you don't fall too far behind?
The tutors are looking for new students, might you know of someone?
Yes this has really made my day. The pandemic really is making a mess out of everything!
That's a great idea! Can you tell me more about the course and what you would like to achieve in the first few weeks?
Of course! You are a very capable person and I have no doubt you will do great.
No problem, all the best to you! Take care!
Hi there, I am so sorry to hear that finals are this week!
I feel you - have you asked for a grade change or anything like that?
Wow thats a lot to take on. Are you studying for any particular subject? Or is it all just general.
It was never a good time to get Covid, but it must be hard being afraid of Covid all over again!
That's a horrible way to deal with work or school. But with a well planned schedule, you might be able to make progress
Remember when your parents moved you to grandma's house after your mothers accident? She put up a big camera so you could watch her while they were away, i found that helpful too
Okay, i'm glad to hear that you are taking care of yourself and are there to get your answers. And don't worry about that paper and finals, you can get through it!
That is totally understandable. It takes a lot of stamina to go back into work after being out that long. We deserve to take care of ourselves
The Covid pandemic is stressing me out in a big way. Things have to change now more than ever. I can tell that there are stressors and issues in your school that are contributing to the stress.
Have you talked to your instructor about it? i am sure she'd really understand.
Not everyone will be able to stay home all the time but it's great that you're home. You've got this!
Great! Well, can you tell me what's been going on and what you want to talk about?
You are being brave and being strong. I'm proud of you.
I'm a little worried for you since this is the 2020. I know that masks can help.
I've been staying inside most of the time. At least when I am outside I see people and we can deal with some issues in real time.
I'm just worried that during the holidays, you may have to celebrate with just the family you're living close to now, or after, to avoid your grandmother's house.
Okay, I'm glad to hear that. If you're not feeling the close contact with them right now, it's perfectly fine to continue not seeing them until you feel comfortable doing so.
Sounds like you're getting ahead of the curve, that's great.
That's great! If I may ask, have you been spending time with your family?
Have you started to feel any relief now that it's all over?
Do you plan on having a family night anytime soon?
Your welcome! Have a wonderful day. My job is finished and I'm exiting.
No, I am not, unfortunately, I am a student in college.
Are you enjoying Christmas? Are you on facebook?
I know it's a challenging year but I think that this too shall pass.
No problem, thanks for talking to me. How are you?
Is there anything in particular that is bothering you?
That is very hard. The pandemic has put everyone in an uncertain situation.
It will take a while for your salary to come through but that is reassuring. Have you considered applying for any unemployment benefits?
It is worth trying! Is there anything else you can do today?
I can understand that. I have been feeling really bad about my life situation as well
Hmmm that is a terrible business to be in. I really feel sorry for you!
I do not know if it will help you but it certainly won't do you any harm.
I know many friends and family have had to go through this - it has been a real nightmare. I am in no way trying to fix it but know it is something to be worried about
Oh I have been in a few situations like that before. Yeah it is unfortunately very true. Do you feel better now?
That is great that you have already started looking. I hope you get your job
You're welcome and good luck to you. I wish you all the best.
No problem, I hope you can make a positive change in your situation.
You too! Take care. bye. 😉 :)
(only i can do it, if you quit from your end
It sounds like you're worried about COVID-19 and are anxious when you're at home?
Are you close to the family and friends in the house?
The news can be frightening and distressing. I understand the anxiety it causes me.
Have you started taking anti-anxiety medications? Because if you have a doctor on call, having some relief is very important in such a stressful time.
Oh, that is good that your partner is supportive. Well, being anxious isn't necessarily a bad thing.
I have created a desk and we have a small table we can use as a workspace outside of the kitchen. For phone calls and a desk where I can work. We also have a mini conference table. It's not a lot but it helps. The good thing about not working from home is I am my own boss in my own apartment
But I must say, we did experience an increase in temp and I don't know how that is going to impact people. The key is to adapt and get through it as soon as possible.
Yes, it is called exposure therapy. I have used it in my own therapy sessions, to cure anxiety. I am learning, taking smaller and smaller steps to get myself outside of my comfort zone.
Yes, the introvert problem is simply a human problem.
However, you mentioned that you don't know why it has affected you so much. Are you aware that it's because of the rules and regulations we all need to follow?
Procrastination and stress helps. Understand it, and it's controllable.
Both are valid and can create high anxiety and stress levels - these can be made worse when you exercise excessive time to think about these things.
Have a nice time. I hope this helps a lot!
I see them too, I thought I was the only one, but there are a lot of people out there helping and coping. They are very supportive of others, and I appreciate the fact that they are so understanding
That is a great idea. Don't let it consume you, take time for self care and personal growth. The world will be fine. It can only get worse if you don't care.
I'm glad. That's all I can do for you tonight. Have a wonderful day!
Hello DJ, I am good. How are you today?
I'm glad I could help in some way, is there anything else I can help you with?
It sounds like you're really working through those feelings and looking forward to more time with your baby, as well as with your grandmother. This is really understandable. Your feelings are natural.
Well, first of all, you have to tell your daughter how you feel. This is the only way you can be sure her well being is the priority. I understand that you are concerned about your mother too. You have to make sure that she is safe and not vulnerable to your husband
It is one of the hardest things on earth, and I think it's real good that you got that right in your heart
It sounds like you are aware of the situation that's going on and the way she feels. I can say that a lot of people get ripped off when they have this relationship.
From what I see, she is going to require a lot of care but I believe she has the potential to heal and move on from this.
Ah I am very glad to hear that! I am sure that she and her family will have many good times to look forward to. I have had such a good experience with my late wife, even though I did cry myself to sleep a few times, it was worth it
That's all you can do for now until the day that she will be able to take steps to leave the bad situation
Are you there? I hope my address is correct :)
Please hit the "quit" button if I haven't stopped talking yet :)
I have to end this conversation now. Merry Christmas!
What is going on? Is there something you are worried about or a situation that is bothering you?
Oh no. Break-ups can be very rough. That's a very stressful situation. How long were you together?
You seem very motivated and determined, and I am sure you will get through this.
That's so hard of you to hear, losing the person that you care the most. I am very sorry to hear this.
It is pretty challenging to stay on top of everything right now with the lockdown, so I understand how hard it can be. I also know how horrible it can be to have breakups especially when you were with the same person.
What do you think could be the best way to get there? Do you have a phone charger, car, or one of your friend's vehicles?
So when I look back on my own experiences, I think I was able to work through problems that other people are more familiar with, but maybe that doesn't help everyone. Do you have a career path that you're trying to achieve through this program?
Do you have any other friends or family that you are with now?
Glad to hear that! I also think that getting this all out on paper will help to let all the feelings go away so your brain doesn't get overwhelmed again! I believe in you!
I am sorry to hear that. What makes you feel that way?
they do? so i would guess you would feel better in an environment that allows for conversation and exchange of ideas?
how does the pandemic make you feel? Do you worry that you will leave school?
oh yeah, i was in the same situation last time, i had a friend who is studying for a test. you could ask them to be your tutor, or you could take their exam next week
Are there other classes that could help prepare you or not taking class in person?
I think it is too late to do a second degree, you need to accept what is happening and do what is best. Do you want a career advancement or a degree?
Yes, there are free study tools like Coursera. For example, there are courses you can take in your city for free. And its paid fees for the degrees. You have to pay $39 for a course.
oh but you do need to invest on Zoom for the student plan. Some schools allow them on the free plan. Its just in your country though
so I can tell you have been a bit worried about the most critical aspects but you have been working hard to do your best and still thinking about your future best
you too! Thank you! And by the way, you can press quit from the chat window by clicking your end.
I am sorry to hear that, what's happened to make you sad?
Oh I see, from what I can gather, you are depressed?
I hear you! Do you and your husband are not having any issues?
It sounds like you're putting a lot of emotional energy into your relationship with your children, as you want them to do better.
Have you tried to communicate with your husband at all? I understand the frustration of feeling like your husband is not showing interest.
Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand your frustration.
Would you want to use video call if you can't actually meet?
You are welcome, I hope I could help. I wish you all the best!
I really hope this was a helpful conversation! Can I give you any other contacts?
Good afternoon. How can I help you today?
Food banks are very hard to use when you are feeling very low but don't worry I'm sure you'll figure it out. If not, it can still be worth fighting for!
Ah I see. Have you considered speaking to someone you trust about what's going on? Perhaps a family member?
The government is not able to fix the situation so the only way out is for people to accept that this is our new reality for a while. Hopefully they will offer more support for people when this is over.
You don't seem to have any other options for now. I am really sorry to hear that. However, you are not alone in this.
Well, there are charities that will lend money for 3 months, food banks that will provide food, etc.
It seems to me that you are in some crisis at the moment and you are not sure how to get out of it?
That is very good! It is better than nothing
Well that's good. There are some big friends in my life who care a lot.
I've had an awful hard time myself in recent years and I've been able to get some support. Have you ever considered attending a national hotline for help?
You're very right, it is. I really hope that this holiday season is not the same for you as the rest of the world.
what do you mean by that? Do you feel you won't be able to find something?
Do you have the TV with you? We have a nice dinner planned tonight.
you too and well done on taking the first step and trying to put things into perspective
How can I help you today? Would you like to talk about anything?
I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about it?
I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure it's difficult to get Christmas presents for 5 children without enough money. Is there a budget limit that you are working with?
And all that money must be really tight right now? I've been in this situation myself and I know just how stressful it can be.
I completely understand. I do sometimes feel that handmade but not necessarily perfect does not suffer from jealousy. Just did not know how else to put it
We can have a look for craft ideas for your kids - maybe we could come up with something that can be made out of the materials you already have?
You could always combine different things if you want. Or you could try and make something simple and really personalize it with the cards or maybe cards will be part of it and you could even have the kids help you write the cards or put stickers on the things
I also think thats a good idea. I have kids, and the looks on their faces when they open their gifts and they have a bag of candy to take home and go around it.
Do you have any family members that you know would like to get some small treats like candies or snacks?
Any idea what size of an ornament you might make?
I'm sure it will be a really fun activity for you both!
It's been super helpful to talk to someone and get your thoughts and feelings off your chest
Do you want to talk about any other issues that you might be dealing with? I'm glad that you're giving your kids the things they need and that you're taking the time to work on your own projects.
How may I assist you today??? I can hear you but you need to communicate
does your friend ignore you or are they ignoring you entirely?
oh it is sad when our friends treat us badly, do you want to try to talk to her and teach her that you do not care about her?
I can understand you are shy as well. make friends in school and school festivals, competitions, etc.
my problem is to do in my daily life is just not to make any new friends
oh yea, i like to go to school and think about the beautiful day when i see students
i love to play games with friends like "hangman", i play bingo games with friends
i really liked to learn that, i always try to share with my friends what i love to do
do you have any work as well? i think i have job in today
good luck to you with this situation, i hope you will be fine
if you need something more let me know. :)
take care and dont be sad :) bye. :))
Hello, how are you? What's troubling you?
That sounds interesting. I'd be happy to help if you would like to share more.
So just to clarify, your friend cheated on you, and you are hurt and don't know what to do. Is that correct?
I am totally a female and and i don't identify as a male.
I have been through a lot of relationships as well, and I am happy to share my experience with you if you would like.
How long has it been going on? Is it a new thing or it always been this way?
I understand the feelings of insecurity and pride, and it is hard to deal with.
Who was the other friend? A new friend?
Let me know if there are any other signs of her being upset or bothered with you that can be prevented? Or do you think she's just being a defensive person?
I can imagine how depressing that makes you and it sounds like you're feeling like the perpetrator here.
It's hard to expect that more from someone. A mother is supposed to be a strong and confident person, but it seems like you feel like she has had her share of emotions around that pregnancy
You are doing something right for her and making her happy and now you are suffering for her behavior.
I'd ask her if she would be willing to go back to her old way of behaving?
You are very welcome. I hope that my words helped.
That is horrible. I can understand the feeling.
So you are really feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. What happened between you and your parents?
I have seen many students feel overwhelmed after the loss of a family member.
You have a parent fight going on and you feel anxious about the bully at school
I am a student too and I know how hard it is to be bullied in school.
It can be very difficult to make friends in a school setting. I can understand that.
Would you consider a school counselor? I think you might really benefit from them.
So you would just like to make new friends.
Do you want to talk to any teachers in the school?
You also said you cannot get help from home. It makes it so hard.
That sounds like a lot of pressure! Can you tell me more about that?
That sounds like a bad situation. How do you feel about your parents?
The most important thing is to find ways to help you get through these hard times.
Just talking to you has made me feel a bit better. That is good to know!
I really hope that it will help you and makes you feel better!
You're welcome. Good luck. Keep smiling.
You're welcome! Have a great day! Got any more questions?
Hello, How are you? :) How may I be of help?
Well, what really got you dumped? Was she holding out for someone else?
I'm sure you have a lot to work through.
Okay. Have you thought about that you would have to really like someone just to keep your old girl?
What's the type of job you work? Do you see any new connections?
The time it takes to get over someone after a breakup depends on the person and their personality.
Time helps us to forget about our ex. It is really a matter of healing.
I agree. Just make sure to keep things casual and not pressure someone.
Maybe you won't have to look for forever.
Your welcome. That is a great step towards moving forward!
how are you doing today? 😊 can i help you?
I'm sorry to hear that! Is it any specific issue that is causing you this distress?
I know that can be very hard. I have been in this situation before and it is a lot more manageable with depression.
Sorry, that makes me sad that's terrible.. maybe we can think of a new plan to succeed
Have you talk to them about how you feel?
I think my suggestion would be to talk to your partner about how you are feeling
As long as they are able to maintain some activity like cleaning and doing daily tasks, you should be able to cope up
It is pretty useful I know! It's a blessing in disguise that you can explore respite options with that in mind.
I am sure that one day, your children can be with your son. Have you considered asking a mutual friend or aunt/uncle who have children with special need to watch your children for a day?
best wishes! Thank you for the conversation! You are most welcome.
By law in many states, gifting is the only charitable donation allowed in certain conditions
Yea, and the emotions of motherhood are a lot. You are doing an amazing job, I know you will do fine
Hello! How are you? Can you give me some information about the problem?
What do you worry about? I'm here to listen.
That's a very tough situation. I know it can be really distressing.
Have you considered maybe getting your ex spouse into counseling?
Perhaps you could connect with other people in your area who may know what you're going through.
I'm sure. It's really good to be able to look forward to phone calls and to get some feeling of being up close.
I'm glad to hear that. That's always great to see and the least amount of travel time. Did you visit any of your grandparents?
I'm glad I could speak with you! I hope everything works out for you.
Gosh. I hope you're able to do it even if it's by zoom. Have you started planning a future trip?
Well you got to stay close to your family and still be able to travel to your boyfriend?
I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you ever considered a therapist to talk to?
That's hard because life is brief and things never go as planned. But sometimes a little effort could do the trick. Have you tried talking to them about how you feel?
I completely understand where you are coming from and I know it can be difficult. Maybe you should make a list of people you are looking to befriend or be interested in.
Make sure that you trust the person before feeling comfortable in approaching them.
That is also a valid argument. But from what you share, it is clear that you are a kind and respectful person. You never can expect you to be accepted by every group of people.
I do not think that anime is wrong to like. I think that it's normal. It's interesting to find out if others like the same things as us. Maybe your friends just do not have similar interests.
Do you have any friends who you feel comfortable with sharing this interest?
Yes, join an anime club! Imagine a large group of people sharing common interests!
I know when I'm working on a project, I connect with coworkers through the same genre of work so we can work together and not look at it differently.
Socially, if you feel comfortable and engaged, you will not get rejected. Just ignore them and they will get confused.
I do not think social rejection is an easy problem. But you can just focus on finding anime related groups in your local area.
I am sure you will be! What about it will make you feel reeased?
I wish you the very best! Good luck!
Sometimes our minds may get over thinking! Don't let it get the best of you.
Hello. I'm sorry to hear that. Is there a particular reason why your kids aren't listening to you?
why don't they listen to you? what makes them not listen?
It's always bad when this happens, I know
yes of course they need to so how what they don't want to study
play games together with them, more value for learning
stay so only and help will not be needed then you are doing the right thing
play to them. that is their problem. you tell them to study and your effort will result in good marks. games is just too much fun.
okay then,dont worry about the money.. keep them from playing games and teach them everything
for me is more important than the games too but don't hesitate
yes because you help your child.i just gave you this advice because you already suggested that
you welcome. i wish you all the best.
Hi, it's a great day today. How is your boyfriend?
Your partner was breaking up with you? Why was it?
Is it the fact that you're so happy you're sad that you're sad?
I think you're making the right decision by doing so because it will help you to move on from it. This is an important part of healing from any breakup.
Are you feeling stressed about it too? It sounds to me like you are overreacting to something that is super common, don't you think?
I believe that everyone faces the opportunity to experience a new chapter in their life and that is what this time is all about.
I am glad you are excited about the Master's. It should give you a great foundation and being in a new place to live and know what to look for too is good. Is there anything else I can help you with?
I'm glad that I could provide you some encouragement! Is there any other problem that is troubling you at the moment?
You're welcome. Good luck with the program and hope you stay healthy too.
I think you are in a great position to make something happen. You have your degree in hand, you are now working on your Master's, and you have a plan for your future. This is a very promising situation.
You are very right. This will take time. You don't need to wait any longer to start your journey, it sounds like you have all you need to do now.
I know you will and I wish you the best of luck.
You are welcome. Have a good night and good luck with school.
Hello, how are you today? Is there anything I can help you with?
Is there anything bothering you? I want to make sure I understand correctly that you are okay.
I am glad to hear that you have a goal. Is there anything in particular you need help with?
Is there a student loan you are struggling with?
if you don't take a loan, then what do you propose to do?
Have you spoken to a college counselor or anyone on campus about the funding?
Which college do you attend? Sometimes schools are quite accommodating when it comes to financial aid.
Have you talked to your advisors and tried to arrange that the grant money be deposited to your student account as soon as it comes in?
Are you in school? I am online too!
I see, you are stressed about the financial aid because you cannot complete the forms without seeing your doctor.
what disability are you receiving? I hear employee's welfare
That is good! Biblical studies is a very important subject, and your parents will be very proud of you for your hard work
Why can you not reach him? Is he fully incapacitated or is he totally incapacitated?
you could try reaching out to the health center at the VA hospital and ask them to see if they can connect you with your doctor
Oh dear that's frustrating. Try to do all you can to push forward. Maybe you could go to another school
they should understand the situation you are in. I believe i can help you
yes and you will be happy when you do.
Merry Christmas to you as well! Maybe it's a good time to think of something else
you too. To other side for me :D
Hi. How are you doing today? Is there something I can help you with?
You are most welcome. How are you today?
Is there anything I can help you with? I am here for you
oh no.. that's so sad.. my wife broke up with me as well last year.. i do not know what i did so right, but im still sad too
i am sorry when am i suppose to tell you why
would you tell her why? I am getting a bit in trouble here
ok so that means that you will have a hard time getting her back
don't let that stop you just go out there find some new hangout spots and just be yourself
hard to give a right answer here but if she said she loved me just stand by it and also find other cool things to do
then make her some nice gifts and start connecting with her somehow
right even your friends are helping you right now haha
oh ok well then maybe do something you enjoy to blow off the energy I wouldn't recommend vaping
I'm doing all right, thanks. What's been on your mind lately?
Alcohol is a bit of a problem for a lot of people I am sure, is that right?
You are worried that your job will find out that you are drinking at work? That is a heavy problem.
Perhaps you might not be aware of this, but many employers are now accepting workplace drug abuse. Are they aware of the nature of your drink at work?
If you drink when you work, it sounds to me like you need to have a chat with your employer and ask them if they are concerned about you.
I would like to think that you would like to give up drinking at work if you thought it was a problem, it seems like you have some feelings about it.
Would you be able to go to your doctor for some help?
I understand that, but I think that most employers will understand if they see that you are really struggling in your role, especially if you have been there for a few years and show a good work history.
Well, in that case you're much better off to stick with your own judgement!
Is that your worry? And the other is fear of being the 'talk of the workplace'?
If you do look into it, I think you'll find it to be really beneficial
Absolutely. I am sure they are all okay.
Are you unemployed? Do you want to get back in the workforce or start fresh?
Im not sure I understand, are you in trouble with the law for anything, or just about your mental health?
What do you say to paying it back? You could treat it to yourself in a few months maybe.
it'll take you a while, more than 6 weeks in fact but it's worth it, and you can't die from doing it.
Omg, there's so much difference there and it's all awful :(
Do you feel like you're stuck in a dead end job or did you recently get a new one?
I know, it sounds very individual. I think you need to find your own solution though and find some advice to sort you out
Good luck!! I am glad I was able to help :)
Ah, really! We do try to help out wherever we can
yes. It is a survey :it will close in 2 minutes.
Hi, how are you doing? Is there anything specific that you would like to talk about?
yes i am doing good, how are you doing today?
Have you had a chance to talk to your friends?
how was your friend? was she a good buddy?
how are you doing? make me feel, so i can do in these time to make you feel better, please tell me how?
or i ask them to take a break for few days and then you can talk to them again
i have tried that before. i used to show them my side of the story, and also give them examples of the argument they got into, maybe it helped then
its not your job to give them time to learn from their mistake, but it has to be a healthy boundary to set.
no problem, you are most welcome. i hope the situation turns out for the best.
and don't miss them, time really is a respect factor
you too! Merry Christmas! Bye! :) (it's the last one
i hope you feel better now, stay safe and stay healthy
Hi, how is life treating you right now?
you can tell me anytime you have a topic you'd like to discuss with me.
why is it sad? there are so many things to do, try to focus on anything that makes you happy, focus on trying things that makes you happy.
How do you think I can help you get motivated?
You're not normal. Anyone is ordinary. we are all meant to be special.
What do you do on your day off?you could ask friends who are your victims and they can be your coins.
You're welcome. Thank you. Hope that you can make the best decision for you.
if you dont mind me ask: what else did you try to do
your suggestion is helpful.then i can help you more.
thats good to know..u can practice those if you ever feel sad. :)
and try to take more time for yourself. anything that doesn't involve others, put more time in for yourself.
you are very welcome. best of luck. Have a good day.
I am sorry to hear that, do you have anything else that you want to talk about?
Do you have the paper in question? I can help you better with the paper.
What made you get a bad grade on your paper?
yes the news of you doing poorly on your paper made me realize how difficult it is to please teachers.
I have had bad grades on papers in the past. it is tough, but that one will happen to you.
Okay well you can always try taking extra credit classes to get your grade up
The midterm test grade is going to be pretty low or if you score 60 i will pass it
was the assignment a group project or a solo assignment?
Wow that must have been intimidating. You should be proud of yourself and them, i bet he was a great teacher
You are very welcome, i am glad to be able to help
You're welcome, have a great day. Love you
hope you are able to get all your work done and have a wonderful rest of your day
Happy Holidays, Have a good year! :) resiluty from your end
Oh i see. You lost your job. When was that? How did that happen?
What about your age? I would love to suggest some specific jobs to you. Some doesth seem relevant but I believe with a little more effort, you would have a job already.
That's good that you both have a support system. Have you been trying to look for a new job?
I see. So you're looking to find something in your own location that you can manage and keep working, right?
Is it too difficult to switch jobs, or is it easy?
Once you find a job, good luck to you both.
Be nearby and be ready. And be prepared to improve. I think you could be in a much better place than you are now.
Hmm, it is always difficult to decide what will work best. If you have a lot of clients in the near future, and you could easily recombine with them there, that might be a good option.
Ok. I don't want you to give up. Can you reach out to your supervisor at your current place of work? They can help you get ahead.
Ok, in that case, maybe it's time to build up a support network of family and friends here as well.
I have thought a lot about this, but I'd say you're exactly on track. You can spend the pandemic year with your family, and then resume your normal routine.
Do you feel you are in the right path?
Great. It sounds like you and your wife are ready to keep moving forward.
That's perfectly reasonable. I'm glad you feel more confident in your options and in yourself.
Hello! How are you feeling? What's going on?
thanks so happy to help you now :) :) I know how you are feeling though
OK I see. I understand how that can cause anxiety. Is it related to their salaries?
I completely understand. I have dealt with similar situations. The best thing you can do is to speak with your manager to let them know how you feel and you would like them to get your peers in line.
Have you reported this? Sometimes reports can help clear up issues.
I am sorry to hear that. Have you communicated your feelings with your manager about this?
It sounds like they feel you are better than them, as a result they don't want to help you or lift your level.
Do you feel comfortable talking to your boss? I'm a regular user of Projectwhiz.
Well, I think that you just need to take care of yourself. I think it might be beneficial for you to seek out a counselor or something. Unfortunately, in today's times, everyone just needs a little guidance and advice sometimes.
You're welcome. I'm so sorry you feel like you need to let this go, it is wonderful that you think of someone else's potential reaction to this behavior.
And take care and be safe too! Have a great day.
Hi, how are you today? _PD and how can I help you today?
how are you doing today? What's on your mind?
Why aren't you good? Anything bothering you?
How is your job? Have you heard anything about a termination?
What companies? So there is something specific in your line of work that caused this fear?
Sometimes this is the hardest thing for people to do, but in the end, it can be one of the best decisions that you make.
When that was announced I know how scared I was. But as the days went by, things started to get better.
Have you made any plans while you were looking for work?
Sometimes it takes a step back and doing other things to help you clear your mind.
Would you be willing to make time for one of your hobbies outside of work to try to alleviate some of this anxiety?
You are welcome! Hope you have a better day.
I am a health insurance field recruiter. I love working with people and helping them through life situations.
I really enjoy meditation, journaling, playing the guitar, and watching movies
Ha, thanks! Maybe I can play some video games with you too!
I live in Denver, Colorado. Have you ever been to the city?
Wow, really? New York State is amazing. I have lived there for about 10 years.
It sounds like they do not see you as a real person and do not care about your feelings. This is very isolating and could make you feel depressed and helpless.
I can understand why you would feel this way. I have had professors that see me as just a number in their classes rather than a human being. Have you tried talking to them about it?
Well, you could explain how their workload affects you and also the seriousness of your work and see how that affects their perspective on how you should feel
Well, I recommend making some social connections that go beyond classwork. Would you like to make any friends in your classes?
Yes, I'm so glad I could help you in some way. If you feel more comfortable talking to me now, is there anything else that bothers you?
It's also very important to remember that you are doing this for your benefit too!
From what I have learned from talking to people in this position, a lot of students who come to college often do not have as much in their support system compared to college students. Do you think you may come across as vulnerable in this conversation?
That sounds like a great idea. Is there a school faith based group that you could find?
I think that is a wonderful idea. I am sure you will be able to find a support group that will help you.
It was my pleasure to chat and support you. I hope you were able to feel better and glad to have expressed your concerns.
Hello, how can I help? What is bothering you?
What is making you feel tired and anxious? Is there anything you could change in your daily life that could reduce that?
Sorry to hear that. It can be very difficult to sleep, especially during this time of year.
Well, do you know if you're having a significant problem with sleep because of stress or worry?
Do you have a partner or friend who could do yoga with you? If you can't stay still, you can stay up for a little while before getting to sleep.
I see. Is there a way you could find some other things you can do to help yourself?
Do you have any support group for your anxiety?
I completely understand. Are there any things you can do to make your conversations with your friends more efficient?
Can you tell me more about what you're feeling? Do you get as high a fever when you're feeling anxious?
It sounds like you have some effective ways to manage your anxiety. How long have you been struggling with it?
Are you having any problems at work that you can talk about? Sometimes talking about our problems at work can help us find a solution.
I'm glad to hear you work a routine and are able to establish a good sleep schedule. I think this is a great start to sleeping better and getting your stress out of your system.
I'm glad to hear that! Do you think it could help alleviate your anxiety as you continue to socialize with your friends?
So it sounds like you are doing great. It's my pleasure to help.
I'm glad to hear that. Take care!
Thanks, that's very nice of you! Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
You're most welcome. I hope you have a great rest of your day!
You are welcome. Have a good one! You quit it :)
Hello, how are you doing today? How may I assist you?
Sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it?
Oh my, that is a tough situation. Can you give me a little more information?
What was the cause of the break up? Did he leave? Were you in it for a long time?
Have you tried to move on by joining a new church? Sometimes people who have gone through break ups join a new church just to avoid thinking about that past relationship
Sometimes the most difficult thing is trying to figure out how that happened and how to avoid it in the future
Yes, I completely understand! I am in the same boat but I found that going on digital dates is easier for me
I have too much going on myself. Then I sit back and meditate to stay present. It helped me stay calm even in the midst of the pandemic.
Sounds like you're really lucky to have a close friend. With my life as well. I am not really in any friendship circles right now but I am able to give back and do some work remotely. Maybe you'll find your people though.
It is ok to just lose friends like that.
Hello. How are you today? Do you need help?
I'm sorry to hear that. What are your unknowns?
Cruise industry? Ah I see. What type of cruise is your job at?
Do you feel so much pressure to keep the job that you're worried that you'll not be able to?
Why don't you try talking to someone in the industry, they might be able to put you into context of the situation and you might see the bigger picture of it.
Can you tell me how long you've been working in that field?
If you can do something you've never done before or decided you want to get out of the cruise industry, it's definitely a good backup plan.
Really? You don't think anyone cares about you at all?
Everyone needs one at this time. Make a plan for your next job. Don't worry if it is no good at first, better to have one place to apply to than nothing at all.
I make a lot of money extra income and blogging, for example.
You're most welcome. Thats the important thing to remember. Good luck. I think you'll do great!
You too! Happy holidays! :) Thank you for the chat!
Good, I'm glad to hear that! Is there anything that's bothering you?
Oh I see. That can be very stressful. Do you have a regular job or are you looking?
If I have to choose how to help you, I'd try to stay positive
I do taking some medication. Just got to make sure you are not in the worst place possible
In this time I've also been taking online classes on social media. I get a little bored with it but I can learn something new to keep myself busy.
I understand. I myself have needed to do pet sitting when I wasn't working. It can be hard to earn enough for the bills.
It is great that you are finding something. Don't let it happen quickly though. Don't take too many risks
I'm sure it is coming. I know it is. You are going to do great.
When it seems like the whole world is failing you and your career, it can be hard.
It will be better soon. I see a bright future for you. I wish you all the best.
Please do share. I am here to listen.
Can you explain to me what you mean by this?
Ok. Are they the ones who have been using you for the past and/or showing up?
Have you tried talking to them about your feelings?
Well, sometimes people do not even realize the impact their behavior is having on you.
Well that's understandable. I understand you don't like confrontation, but how would you feel if someone did that to you?
That is a good idea if it does not make you feel at peace. Can you see it as not putting you at an undue stress?
You seem to understand this way but that doesn't necessarily mean it will become a fact.
Have you ever gone to counseling? If so what was your experience with it?
I am glad I could assist, I wish you the best of luck with that!
Hello! How can I help you today? Can I pick you up from under these harsh restrictions?
What's on your mind today? I'm here to listen
Merry Christmas to you as well! How is your day going?
How are you? :) Did you not get time to talk today?
Wow, it sounds like you are feeling depressed and you don't know why it is happening
What is it that is causing you so much distress and depression?
Ahh I see how that would feel that would be very hard to get through
have you tried an Online substance Abuse and Drinking program
Maybe you could be doing your applications on Google or something, that way you can check your phone and your call can come back and not miss it.
So if you are willing to do something for free you are willing to put in the work, that is great
Tell yourself I believe in you and that you can do it and won't let the depression get the best of you
You will see things start to improve soon. It will help to always keep yourself busy by doing things you enjoy and sometimes doing this will help your anxiety go down
You can accomplish this! It is the way of a nner
I hope to have met you tonight and I hope to have been able to provide you with the support you need
Have you tried meditating to help you control your feelings?
You are doing the right thing with more positive thoughts.
And trying to see a professional for help as well
It was my pleasure and I will talk to you again.
Thank you and stay healthy. Merry Christmas from my end
Hello! How are you doing today? I am here to listen
What kind of people? What do you mean?
Do you have any problem in your life that I can help you with?
I see... That really hurts, I can't believe this is true.
I think some people may be trying to gain attention, maybe you should try to keep away from them
I completely understand. It is so difficult to know who to trust.
Perhaps someone else is holding a different view and that they have valid reasons as well.
That sounds a bit like stress over to you. Don't you think there could be a way of reducing stress in the workplace?
Ah, breathing is a wonderful tool and you are making the most of it!
I just worry about people not wearing them and could get sick, so I don't like it too much.
Have you spoken to anyone in your management about how you are feeling?
I assume your manager is trying to make things fair for all the employees.
That's wonderful to hear! I hope you will consider other suggestions I suggested as well. There are many things you could do to improve your mood today and is good that you are exploring these options.
Do you have any other issues you want to share?
I am glad that everything is working out, stay safe and have fun!
Do you have any hobbies you can engage in when you are not at work?
How do you know? any idea about his age?
That is a really good question. How did you lose your friend's father?
I understand that it is hard to be in close contact and keep a safe distance but I also understand how it could be hard to pay respects, especially when it is such a big loss.
my wife and i went out a few days ago to go get some good fresh air and also by a nice stream and running water. her son, I now refer to as Cody, is helping me out a bit too and also he is going out for walks. So maybe you can make plans to go out for a walk or a long run with your friends?
oh i hear you there. doing your best to make the best out of the situation has to be enough.
yes its cold where i live. and it is snowing like crazy.. I am having the same thing. its all fun as its winter but is beautiful though. so you have your excuse. let's learn to focus on the positives. and think positive too.
do your other family members have some sort of hobbies that you can make time for?
oh, your country. Im sorry you have to deal with that. i know how you feel, im in my fourth year of med school and im also worried about going back to my family and country.
have you heard of the monoclonal antibody treatment for covid?
thank you! enjoy your rest of the day!
Hi there, sorry to hear you're going through this.
Why does he just drop you? I need to know more before I can provide any advice.
You don't see him online anymore? I assume that means he dropped you?
So you didn't see him online? Do you have any idea why he did that?
I can definitely understand that. It seems like you've already thought about how to block him. I am sorry you're dealing with this.
Don't need to try to play games. Can you do something to get out of negative thought?
I think it will be fine. He will find out when he stops chatting that you are not interested
I can understand you feeling the same way. What about finding new friends
Well, I would start taking classes, work out, start looking for a house you can rent, you never know
However, with the pandemic, it can be very difficult. One thing you can try is donate your stuff online
If you do find a new partner, make sure he is great and you are happy together!
It sounds like it has been a very bad year for all of us, yes?
That's my hope! Hope it helps. You're strong!
See you know, when guys talk to you, just quickly shut your mind. If he calls, just pretend you are a friend doing something you like doing on the computer.
Good! Try not to think about him if he is contacting you. When you think about him, just think about him thinking about you.
Hello, how are you? I am here if you need to talk.
Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. It seems to me that there is something bothering you.
Just by talking to me, I can already tell that this is going to be a very problem friend, so you can consider them the best friend possible. I am not a good friend to be good at sometimes.
Sounds like she might not be following your routine. It can be frustrating to do as we spend so much time with one person.
I would suggest taking some time off from your friend to look after your own feelings.
Yes. Her way of speaking over you is generally bad so I am sure she can tell what you are feeling if you ask her.
I do feel sorry for what she is going through so that is a motivation.
Are you willing to open up? Or are you hesitant?
I completely understand, but I would suggest not being too hard on her, the worst she can say is that you did something to upset her.
That sounds like a good plan, you can just give her some space and then reach out when she feels more settled.
Well, if you think that and still have the desire to talk with her, try not to let it stress you out, it might not be as bad as you think.
Please continue by the end if you can, if you can't you must press quit, please wait for me to quit the end or it wont work for you :D
Having things work out, like getting to know my girlfriend, has been such a blessing. Good luck!
Anyway, its been my pleasure, i wish you the best and please take care
Hello there, how are you today? I can hear you through the webcam.
i am so sorry to hear that. making friends can be very difficult, especially in today's world. I am sure you are able to make friends and have good friends. I am living with my mom right now. I never thought I would do that but she loves me.
what has been going on? some sort of problem?
oh, I see. what do you mean by that?
im sorry to hear that. Do you have a good doctor or podiatrist that you talk to?
are you currently attending any meetings? are you into a particular type of program or are you just starting out?
its a very hard situation, i am sure you will be okay and dont think about it. do you think your friend would be willing to help you?
sounds like you have had a tough time moving to a new state, i'm sorry to hear that.
yes, sadly. I cannot support the army anymore because I chose to wear my pink heart ribbons. it is supposed to be to show our support for our country. So being hurt was why I was not willing to do it.
it sounds like you may just need to tell your mom or dad a little secret, they might be able to offer some good advice.
have you thought about going out for drinks, that way you could let him know you are okay and find another close friend to talk to, if he is okay with you hanging out?
that must have made things a lot more complicated.
that is nice. do you think you could also try to talk to your fiancé about your problems, he may be in a position where he is able to provide you with support and advice
would it be hard for him to come visit you as well?
well thats great!! it's all of the above, all of the above,
you too! We did not even know we were on a pause so the feedback and test loaded. thank you so much!
Hi, how are you? How can I help you?
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on
There must be something that is going on that is troubling you.
Im sorry to hear that. Are there any students that you could ask for help or is that a one way street
Okay that is bad. They must be very annoyed by that.
I am sorry you are having this problem. I think you should give it to another opportunity.
You should just stress about the situation and take it serious and don't let it bother you.
Can you try contacting your local paper? Maybe you have a article published recently or maybe if there are a few outstanding issues they will write about it.
It is completely fair to expect them to prioritize you for these opportunities.
You can still be appreciated even if its not a supervisor position.
My idea is your give up the supervisor role and you can work for the rest of them
Perhaps it would be easier if you spent some time helping out in a supervisor role for the next few months.
That is a good one! I can see you are already working hard to solve the problem with the best you can.
I am sure they will see that you are the mentor you can be.
Its possible that you will find a solution to this situation, have you been looking into solutions on your own?
Your welcome and I hope you have a good rest of your day!
How are you doing today? Is there anything that needs talking about?
I am sorry. How is your feelings? Do tell!
Can you explain a bit more? How is it weighing on your mind?
Well, birthdays seem to be getting more stressful for you with time.
If I had to reflect on my life I remember self-hatred often, even up to my 30s, and it would often be related to specific birthdays.
I can understand what you are saying, as being autistic I experience different kinds of thoughts and emotions than non-autistic people.
I grew to enjoy going to see my dentist even more!
I used to be a bit tired of using societal norms as my own personal game of self reference and remind me who i am!
Does your work give you any sort of hope or purpose?
Well, I'm glad I could help, and I appreciate the effort you put into this! Thank you!
What job were you trying to get? Do you have the skills for it?
It's great that you know your support groups! I have been on the autism spectrum since I was a kid and my own therapy.
That's great. It's been nice talking to you too. It might be hard to end, but that's perfectly fine.
Ha. I am not actually trained as a counselor, but I am always interested in learning more about what that work involves. And you are correct, this is for training!
Maybe one day I can help you. I hear about autism.
Cool! I just started it, too. I actually just thought it was a website game :)
Haha. Well, thanks for talking! Bye :)
You too. Have a good day/night :)
Just leave. Thanks for chatting with me, and enjoy your birthday.
Hello there. I am so sorry to hear that.
So, it sounds to me like your friend may be feeling that you too are a liar. How is this making you feel?
I see. Did you know about the lie before it was revealed?
That's great that you are happy to see that your friend is out there to see you the way that you deserve.
Are you open to any of the lie being true, just for the sake of listening to your friend? Or is the lie meant to be true?
Have you ever told your friend you felt hurt about the lie?
Ok. I am glad that he apologized and you feel that his words have changed him.
Do you feel comfortable sharing some details about the situation?
That's not a good situation for you. Is your boss open to changing things?
You need to feel like you'll be taking care of this by dealing with HR or your co-worker, and I feel like you need to be part of deciding. It sounds like you are being ambushed by your boss's hump.
Would you try to talk to her in a gentle, non-judgmental manner to see if you can get an answer to your question?
You need to talk to your boss to try to find out what was going on and how they plan on doing this in the future.
Do you live with her? If so, then it might be a good opportunity to have lunch with her and get some quality time. You do not need to just physically be together, just communicate with her. You can easily send her text messages saying she is valued and appreciated.
Ok. I'm glad we are making progress.
Well I hope that isn't your living space that's the problem... I think you'll be okay.
I am sure that there is nothing wrong with your mind, you are not to blame for the situation. You are a victim of circumstance.
Of course. And remember to give your co-worker some credit for her hard work. You could always mention that it would help her looking for a new job.
Please do! You should check in with her every day. It's okay to express your feelings to someone who understands. I hope that you can come out of this feeling better.
Is there any particular issue causing you to feel like this?
It seems that you are really grateful for your mom. Do you think you will start to disagree with her if they become angry?
Can you tell me more about that? Do you feel that her is judging you and your choices?
That seems like a good chance you can pick your own friends and she won't approve that.
I had to ask them more questions. I had to make my mom understand why I made those choices.
Do you have other family members like that? How about other friends?
She understands your feelings when you say she doesn't like your friends.
What are her concerns? I am sure she can be understanding if you give her time and space.
Ok, you are a great person just doing your best.
Have you tried any friendship goals together? I think that will help her see that you want the best for them too.
You don't need to buy her a gift. just mention these points and make her understand
you are welcome. be better and you will have better relationships
Hello, How are you? How may I be of help to you today?
What are the problems that you are facing? Why are you getting burned out?
I understand that quite a lot. It has been shown in research that someone who becomes a therapist will not get as burned out.
I understand. It is rather a form of limbo isn't it? To be outside but not within. Do you think you'd like to stay with the therapeutic relationship? Or are you feeling about to leave that to go out and find another role?
Sounds like a good conversation to have. I think that most people can understand that just because it's something that they need to pay the bills they don't need to enjoy it.
There might be some spare-time therapists out there who could take on your patients temporarily. You could always drop them off temporarily and then pick them up.
That would make it even more admirable! You're not just going away to relax. You're supporting people.
Well, once you have retired it's easy to be redundant at any stage.
Well that's just one solution. How much is your work load?
Yes well, isn't it just to worry about how the future might unfold? Well hopefully computers aren't very worrying.
I see. It is definitely an important job though, I mean, no one likes feeling bored or unfulfilled.
Oh - no I am sure you could make it work. Perhaps there are ways to make the job easier for you. The working environment would be a good place to talk to.
What do you think your patients might be like? Does the job require you to interact with patients at all?
No problem! You are most welcome! It was lovely talking to you!
Why do you think you could be better? Hope I am asking the right questions, please tell me.
I understand, The moment I learned about it I knew I needed help as well. The drug I took after seeking a true expert helped me get over this.
Well it seems like you have a plan in place so lets let's focus on why you are coming here!
That sounds like a great way to talk. It makes a good idea to show them your track history so they know the effects of your meds.
Wow, I can feel your depression through the screen. Why do you feel you are crying every day?
Oh wow that is a lot. You are 30 you are right 30 and you are still you. There are a lot of issues that are brought to light. It is a lot of work for her. You will get some tools to help you through this. Do you feel like you have anything you can talk about?
You did the right thing by talking to someone today and im sure you will find one more that suits your needs.
I understand that you want to stay calm in times of doubt, but if it is not working then it's time to do what is best for you.
No problem! Do you have any other questions?
I can imagine i'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a lawyer?
Ah yeah my son keeps crying when he doesn't see daddy
Right they are looking forward to see you do absolutely everything on your own so you be the best mommy ever. Go do your best so they will know you are doing your part to help them understand this doesn't mean they are not your child
Yes that will help you relax and soothe your mind but just take 30 minutes for yourself that will make a big difference.
I know people in my community just do not understand. Some people feel that our problems are not important to them. They don't see how hard we are working.
Keep in mind it is a work on himself. Give yourself a fight and take care of those boys!
Well it's always good to hear that you're pursuing someone new, even if it's the wrong guy. You will realize it soon enough. And I'll be sure to remember that with you as my best friend in the future! I'll stop you from making any of these mistakes.
Haha that's pretty important! I think it's the balance most men would be good at meeting those two things but it's hard for them.
We all miss our woman in the family every day.
Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about it?
I'm so sorry to hear that. What parts of your job is it that she has taken away, that makes you feel so down?
What are your job and what type of work do you do? And can you give a little more information?
I think if you push her on her boss, that could give them an idea of what a great job your team is doing. Would you think that might be worth discussing with your boss?
It's definitely hard to keep up but if you stick together, you'll survive
You should take her talent and not bully her! She can teach your boss valuable things
Yes I can understand that. I have taken in mind that having only one or two job is very stressful and does not leave many time or energy for myself and my family at the same time. I believe that you do have time for your family and your self care. I really think that you should talk to your boss about the fact that you should be given time to enjoy some of your job and not be over worked.
It seems to me that if she is looking to advance in the company, it is up to her to make the right decisions. Your company has some bigger plans in store for her.
Are you certain you have enough evidence to go against her? Also as a secondary points maybe show her how you're struggling to do her job but she refuses to listen
I completely understand - that can be a great way to end it all however. Maybe then you can leave with your head high or just as we speak
Maybe you could set up an appointment with HR to get them in on it as well?
I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk more about it?
Oh, I can understand how that would be stressful. I have a lot of trouble speaking up in large groups, too.
No I don't speak in front of many people, but I've learned how to avoid panicking.
Well, it sounds like you have the option of joining a study group to help you with your classes. Is that something that you'd consider?
I don't feel compelled to participate more than others. As an aspiring counselor I've only done a little bit of public speaking in the high school theoreetical class to get prepared for high school then I barely did it at all.
I can understand why you are feeling this way. This is definitely a challenge and I can see you are at your wit's end.
or practice in front of your mirror (ugh)
Maybe getting a quiet room for your presentation will help, and your partner maybe can be your back up?
I'm sorry you are dealing with this, it is nothing that can't be overcome and there are many resources online. May I suggest talking to your therapist or even a counselor
How would you say the students feel as for the situation too?
Wow that's good, I have actually been medication for some time after I hit rock bottom, but I really want to just be sober now as it brings a lot of peace
Have you tried God? I don't believe in God as I understand the different perspective of the Bible
Prayer is definitely very effective and i think it is the best help
we live in a society where the most effective people are in positions of power so it works there too
Have you spoken with your friend in the past that you worried about and been able to comfort. I know a few of them that will tell you exactly the same things I do
Thank you for talking with me. God bless. Your time is also important.
Yea correct well it is a complete physical and mental battle for me.
Hello, what seems to be on your mind?
Is there anything on your mind? or do you have a special request?
It sounds like your cousin isn't really there to support you. Has she ever ignored your attempts to support her?
I can see why this would be upsetting. Is there anything specific that she has done recently that you are upset with?
Have you tried to talk to her about the kind of things she is worried about?
I think that would be a good start. I think that maybe it's better to sort out your feelings about her husband first and work that out.
Maybe you could try talking to her about the counseling and the role you think a professional role would play in this relationship
I can tell from your message that there is a lot of emotional abuse going on with your girlfriend, but I am sure that you would be better off in person, to have an uninterrupted conversation with her.
Perhaps you should ask her, is this serious enough for her to seek a medical professional?
Have you started speaking with her? Let her know you don't mean to cause her distress and encourage her to set those boundaries with you.
Well. The alternative is that she has this far gone depression. I think she has been saying something like that for a while, if she's still speaking about it, there must be something going on. Does she have any other issues besides depression?
No problem. Have a good rest of your day.
Have a great New Year! See you next year!
And don't forget to stop and smell the roses!
Good afternoon. How are you? Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
Is there a particular reason you feel that way?
I am sorry to hear that, and I can understand how worried you are. Do you have anyone that you can talk to?
It sounds like you are a very ambitious person. So you think that you would be better off participating more in the political game?
Could you speak with them and ask them what they are worried about?
That is great. Working out is an excellent way to relieve some stress and add to your physical health. Maybe you could even connect with friends and exercise together?
I am not a perfect person, but I have tried many sports. Many of them, I would say that hitting a ball the most makes me feel calm
Have you tried a mindfulness practice? Even just for a few seconds a day? Sometimes when I am having a rough day I will sit down and take a deep breath and practice some meditation.
It sounds like you are definitely trying out your new trails and roads. It is great that you can do it once a month to stay active.
I think it is good to make an effort for a workout or two before you feel frustrated or worried. Do you have someone you like to chat with when you feel anxious?
That's so cool. I bet it's really nice to be able to get out and do something in the snow. I have never had snow.
You are very welcome! I hope that we are able to get through this as a society
Mark suffers from bipolar disorder? That can be very challenging for him.
I can see that this is difficult for you. How long have he been suffering from bipolar disorder?
I understand that you are feeling confused with your friend mark. I can understand that. I have a friend who was very self-centered and started to take more and more medication without the others noticing.
Have you tried talking to anyone about this with a close family member? Sometimes it's good to talk to people that are close to someone about their family health issues
It might be easier to talk to his doctor but you have to see his doctor's response as well.
It sounds like your friend is having a major crisis in his life and you are trying to take care of him.
Have you talked to his doctor about this? There is a consultation service for your family that you can call and talk to them about this. They can help you in finding a solution.
Maybe getting him to do a random drug test would be good, and maybe he could be medicated depending on the test results. That may help him become more accountable. I know you have to stay calm when talking to him and not let him get under your skin.
How does your relationship with him feel overall after this conversation?
yes. My mother is in her sixties and she has bi-polar. It has been going on for 25 years. I am now in my forty-seventh year and have never had it.
So to answer your question... you could take a walk outside.
Okay, can you tell me a little more about the bi polar diagnosis?
Okay... first of all you have to remember that you are not alone in this.
additionally learn about bipolar and with that knowledge you can tell if he has diorder.
you too! have a good one. Bye.
thats all i can do. I wish you all the best.
hi! how are you? how can i help you?
I am doing well. I am glad you're here. What brings you here today?
Is there anything I can help you with? If not, is there anything else I can do to help you?
Just to make sure I get it right... you are feeling blue because you think the seasons are short and the days are getting darker too far?
You're absolutely right. staring a computer all day won't fix anything. Sometimes we need a change of environment.
Spends an hour baking brownies and making it chocolate smell amazing. Sounds heavenly.
I think you sound a really great person though! This is really hard for you. I am so sorry you are having to go through this.
I actually enjoy playing the trumpet. It makes me feel happy and well happy
I would say get out and do your walks. You really could surprise yourself.
I think you might just be a happy person that has been up for too long. I know it's hard but there has to be a way to counteract it.
You don't need a destination. Does walking help you at all?
Do you have close friends? I have been staying away from people too and i just listen to their songs. i just went to the blue jean dead music store and i picked up nice boots and steiger's shirts.
yes that sounds like your situation. Virtual reality is a great thing because it can be safe and fun to connect with people virtually.
Thats great. Do you ever feel sad?
How can I help you today?))?️🤔
I'm doing well, thank you! How can I help you?
I totally understand. What are some things you want to accomplish this year?
I see, it sounds like you have a lot of stress on your mind and feeling bad about yourself. Do you think that your work life matches your personal life?
We used to do much more. I grew up in a household where youraturday was seen as the weekend, but the young generation is completely baffled by that!
That's awesome! They have their whole lives ahead of them. I understand how important that can be.
The first year without them will be a looong time
You're feeling guilty for enjoying your own time, that's a really hard thing to deal with! Its not wrong to prioritize your own happiness, in fact, it is essential in the long run. People who worry all the time end up stressed out, tired and happy, long story of the past. And don't worry, I'm not judging you, it just happens.
Yes, it is some of the hardest to change myself. But I feel that I can be of some use by helping others. Now if you put that into yourself, and you are just being kind, I believe you will start to feel better about your situation and at the same time, you will allow others to show you the love you so desperately need. I have to mention that I live and live in an urban area so there isn't much quality time for each other! But I remember the
hello, how can I assist you today? could you please elaborate?

Great, and you are very welcome :) Thank you
goodbye! Have a great day! :) :)
your welcome! have a good day! Bye!
is there any chance you can end the session and exit
Hi! What is wrong? Do you want to talk about something?
Are you by any other means interacting with other people?
Yes getting a puppy can be difficult too! Sometimes I've thought that I should try one, but others were more excited about getting one
That is horrible that he's working from home. And that is horrible that you both lost one thing.
Yes! That sounds perfect, yes! And if you guys want to consider getting another one, I'm sure it would also be fun for you and your kids too.
I have a beagle named Lola. She was extremely anxious and lonely when I left home. I had her trained to calm me down.
My puppy's name is Luna. She's a golden retriever.
Well, there is no need to go back there! Being home for now is definitely better than being out in an office.
Great! We'll see what happens when I work from home. It's great that you're working with your kids!
I think you know exactly what you're looking for. What you don't know, isn't what you are!
It's my pleasure! I think it's time to look into just getting a new pet, maybe a new dog or cat...or some other cute creature.
You too! I hope you have a wonderful year and stay safe!
What makes you so sad? Is there anything specific going on?
I am very sorry to hear that. That is so hurtful. Can you tell me more about how you feel?
It is not her fault, they just didn't think. She is a hard person. I think the best thing you can do is to let her know how her actions made you feel. Maybe she has no idea that what she did is unacceptable and this will help you understand her.
So, can you get a translater to help you have a discussion with her?
Do you know any other methods that may help? Sometimes other people can understand you through a lot of non verbal means
No, you are still alive and healthy, but maybe you should think about seeking therapy. It sounds like you are in great need of it.
I totally understand and it's obviously very hard right now but you will get through this.
Well at least she will know you love her, so that's something!
Wow, that's an awful thing. I can imagine you don't want her anymore after learning she was with someone she was trying to move on with
Do you have any other friends left? Good friends? Can you really go on?
I think you've been having yourself a little too hard on yourself, that's good.
Tell me you wouldn't look that way? lol
Wow, that's going to be rough. And poor you for not feeling bad enough to talk to her.
I see. I do not know what I would do, but I don't think it would be very good.
I know we all have bad days sometimes. I am sure your mom just wants the best for you.
Good luck to you and hope you get to cross the road successfully. Stay safe.
Perhaps I need to join a forum like that again :D
Please send the help! :( :D :D :D :D :)
what happened? when did it happen? what made you feel that way?
What do you mean "broke your heart"
I can feel how sad you are. Don't think you were doing everything right, you could never know for sure for sure.
I'm sorry to hear that. How have you been feeling since the breakup?
It sounds like the relationship was going well and it was a big shock to you.
What about getting new friends or working on your hobbies?
As long as you are still getting higher education, a career is only a matter of time
Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
That sounds like a great idea! What's your rough idea of where you would like to travel?
I know what that feeling is like. I had my first pregnancy and it made me feel very nostalgic and introspective, which really helped me.
You're welcome, I'm glad I could help! It is a tough season, but you're doing the best you can!
So you are feeling anxious? What is bothering you?
I'm sorry to hear that. How is the situation that you are in at work?
Have you applied for unemployment? Do you need financial assistance?
Are you aware that unemployment still only goes up to date of current circumstances?
May I ask if there are any other issues you'd like to discuss?
Yes, that's also one of the problem for many people right now. Do you have any other way of making money?
Yes you need to take care of yourself first because if you cannot keep your mind off of the financial situation you're going to get anxious and you'll pass out.
I would definitely suggest using breath control for your anxiety. It can help you relax and really focus on your mind and center.
Yes it does. I believe it does and you can try it out right now for a few minutes to see if it can improve your mood and control your anxiety.
Absolutely! I hope it has made a difference for you.
Great, happy to help! Take care! :)
From what I've observed with yoga, it promotes relaxation and calmness and greatly reduces anxiety. You're welcome! Have a wonderful night!
I am fine. How are you doing today?
So, what happens when you call them? Do they respond?
So it sounds like you've had good relationships with your friends and nothing bad has changed. In that case, I would talk to them and say something like "hello, it's been a while since I last talked to you. I know things have changed since COVID, but I want to make sure that we can still be friends. Can you talk to me about why you are distancing yourself from me and what has changed for you that would make you think that?"
I am sorry to hear that. And I have to ask, are you in the same state as they are? Since we are still in the same state and everywhere else is "forcing" people to be so distant. Are you isolated?
That must be very difficult for them to see because you want to be physically close with them. How have you felt about this situation?
Well I can tell you have tried to reach out to your friends but you have found that they do not want to reach out to you because you are getting precautions. Is that correct?
Well that makes sense. I can understand why you feel left out of these relationships when you don't have anyone that understands and agrees with your point of view.
I completely understand that! I also played hockey in college. This is a very tough time for a lot of people.
I am sorry it has been hard for you to find friends as well
I'm sorry it's cold and you can't go out - I understand that! I don't think there are a lot of options that involve close contact to people either. The fact that you don't want to go out and it's hard to get off the couch is understandable. I think the opposite might be true and that if you did go out playing sports it might be a great opportunity to socialize with others
I understand that you were feeling somewhat desperate and you felt that you wanted to join a book club but was worried about putting yourself in a situation where you might be seen as someone that doesn't respect your health.
Okay, good luck! Have a wonderful day.
Merry Christmas! Have a wonderful holiday season.
And in my end, you have to hit quit before I can give you the final answer!
how are you? how was your day? any problems?
All is well? Hope I didn't lose you in the middle of the day. How can I help you today?
There has been a lot going on in the world that could make someone depressed, just tell me what it is.
I am sorry to hear that, I have been in that same situation. What are some of the things you have been doing to cope?
So you've been feeling lost since the rape and are struggling with identity now?
Well it's all worth it. We'll get through this together!
Is there anything specific that bothers you about your new partner?
If he doesn't have empathy, I would likely encourage them to seek help for that and if he continues to pursue you then he might benefit from it too.
I completely understand it may take some effort to move into a new relationship where this is considered.
It's nice to know that you are on the right track to finding someone special. Keep in mind, it is going to be a process.
You're welcome. I hope everything works out for you. I wish you the best.
I am doing great thanks for asking. How can I help you?
Oh no, are you having financial issues? Can you tell me more?
Yes, that is correct. I know that being in charge and trying to keep people happy, can be stressful and exhaust your mind. I understand.
That's terrible! I know that can be a challenging time. I have lost friends with my kids at home. It's a struggle, but you're doing an awesome job. As a parent of two, this can be super exhausting for you, but you're not alone.
In what ways are you able to interact with other children? Have you had any success with them?
Hello! What's wrong? Can you tell me?
You are welcome, have a great evening too!
(check out some of those amazing youtube videos that are free to get you through some more time
Hi. how are you today? Would you like to tell me about your troubles?
That is totally normal and valid. Do you have a specific reason for feeling this way?
Is there something specific that is bothering you today?
I'm so sorry that you are going through this. What industry do you work in?
Was your job recently or how long have you been out of work?
It is a lot of pressure though when the job market is not what it was. However, being unemployed is not the worst thing that can happen. I think that you just need to keep looking!
As someone who's been in the same situation as you, I can tell that it is deeply upsetting.
Okay. Have you ever thought about volunteering? Sometimes I've found that volunteering can lead to better job opportunities later on.
Is there anything you feel is missing in your current job?
That is a difficult situation to be in and it's so hard not to panic, which I know we all are in this year
That means you are a single parent, right?
I understand how that is, and I'm glad you are thinking about taking care of yourself!
You're very welcome! I hope you get paid soon so you can move on from this. Don't let this stress get the best of you. I hope it's temporary.
Is there anything else you want to talk about?
Have a great rest of the day! Bye!
Maybe you could try a hot shower. That might be just the thing.
Feeling secure is good. Does this sound like it could be related to something that has been going on recently?
That is a pretty straight forward and honest statement. Are you feeling isolated at night?
Do you have any friends that you can talk with?
I had to talk about this issue to a very close friend, and she supported me and helped me to move forward.
I think a good support group may be a good idea to you to talk about it with others.
That is good to hear, though, that you can not feel comfortable with animals.
I feel your pain and think that it is good to support someone through it, you must feel as i do.
You sound like you are feeling a lot better and hope for a better future.
I can understand the problem because my sleep is the most critical part of my life. There are great stress relief at the tip of my mind, I sleep just as much as I think.
Have you ever considered seeking help to those who may be able to understand your situation?
Do you have dogs or other pets that may bring you comfort?
I can assure you that it will be worth the effort.
I am here for you. I hope this helps.
Do you think you can try one of the ideas provided above?
I can understand that a lot. I have also been down for months. But don't worry, you will get through this.
That's a huge step back. It's not the lack of money that would get to you, but the fact that you've had to make so many significant adjustments to your life.
I hope that this space allows us to talk more openly and honestly with you. Is there anything else that you feel would be helpful?
I completely understand and for those of us with chronic conditions such as depression, a year seems like an eternity.
That's a great start! I think you can feel positive because you have made a list of all the good things that you want and they are achievable, so you should feel confident about it all.
Would you be happy if your life started to feel a little bit more positive despite the worries and uncertainties?
Yes I once joined a Cycling class and was much impressed by the progress we made!
Well, have you considered joining a book club?
I've never had a cat and I've found they are good companions.
Wow that is so great! You do need to make time for them because of all the bonding you do.
Well I hope you find something that helps you out. Do you any other preferences?
Wow you're moving into a new apartment. I don't know how you did it
Then maybe having a job which is also helpful to them could be a good way to make a difference in your community as well!
They are offering this at some of the local libraries too
You're very welcome! It's been lovely talking to you too.
Oh sure! Good to hear! What is bothering you?
how can i help you today? (from your end)
lost your job? so you know been without a job for some time
have you tried to have a little talk with him?
can you tell me more about this person and the fight they make you?
its especially hard when its getting to be a daily thing with the kids like that
Hmmm I can see why you would feel frustrated. Do you think your kids are better off living with either one of you?
You should do it again or talk to your husband. Why do you think he still doesn't know?
Let me know if i can help you any further.
yup. if you think you should try to get counseling. thats really important. It could be some good advice.
You should take care of the kids. It is a family issue, that means you are responsible. Sometimes the husband is also able to take care of the kids, because they really love the kids, and they want to take care of them. But it's not always easy to keep up with the kids, too.
I wouldnt suggest a break. I think your husband need to know how he is disturbing your husband.
maybe you need to have a talk with him.
No need to get angry. Let him know how you feel. Is your relationship good enough to tolerate his behavior?
I am sure it will. By working with your husband you can fix it.
stay strong! THANK YOU! :) Good luck to you and your family
Oh i am sorry. Can you share with me why?
Is there anything I can help you with? Be it a personal problem or health
Does this one affect you more than another? I just cant read those numbers sometimes.
Well first let's not beat around the bush a lot of people are feeling trapped or unsure right now and it seems to be so hard for people to find a direction
Some people suggest exercising more this is a good way to feel better.
I can tell you have a lot on your mind
I personally think that even though things are hard we can still get through this it won't be long until we are back to normal
I am a little sad as well that the virus is ongoing this is very tough for me
I am in the process of rehoming myself recently
Do you have qualifications to work in a certain field?
I was worried about that too, but I went for small and very small programs to try to get something
I can totally understand if you are in this much debt you should at least keep it going
From what I have learned MOOCS are amazing!
I understand I just had loan debt as well but I wasn't depressed
I think some people are stronger than others but we can all get through this
I think a lot of people in this country don't know that
I hope you will relax and stay strong and handle the situation the best you can
Anytime good luck everything goes your way :) Have a great evening
I'm glad you feel better and thanks for being here :)
See you next time :) and share your success!
You need to press quit to finish and I can't
You feel sad? Yes, what is happening?
It is a natural feeling to feel that way after trusting someone again, but it sounds like you have a valid concern and you want to explore the feeling of trust in your friendship.
I understand how you feel. I went through a breakup like that and it was very hard. Do you want to talk to me about your boyfriend?
Oh no, that is completely unacceptable. You did the right thing by not trusting him and getting away from him as soon as you could
Was this all a long time ago? I know that can be a very difficult situation
Perhaps you need to think about maybe he was not interested in you and you just were a lonely kind of person for him.
That must have been really hard. Unfortunately I also know what that feels like
Maybe if you help someone who is being cheated on, you can feel better
It's normal to feel that way. Sorry that he hurt you.
I know how frustrating that must be. I've never had to go through that.
Well, from a neutral perspective, you would probably cry if he did.
That can be very depressing when someone doesn't respond to you. I hope things improve for you soon!
I understand and I also would cry sometimes. In fact I cry more often than I think about it.
Just focus on yourself right now and let the tears happen.
I get it. I used to post after posting I needed to disconnect and do something with myself.
Sometimes you just need to block everything out that he is doing and then just try to live.
It sounds like it's hard for you to "feel" enough to have enough of someone else.
I know how that feels when your biggest friend isn't being your friend.
You are welcome. I am sorry that you had to end our conversation but know you will find a wonderful person in the near future
Hello, how are you? What brings you here today?
I'm sorry to hear that, I see that things are going poorly for you
Why is your project so complex? Is it a new client for you or has your usual workload increased?
When this happens I get anxious as well. Have you tried reducing your responsibilities to spare some more time?
I believe if you go through it and get a handle on the tasks, you'll be able to do your personal life and be more focused in your work.
Sometimes, in order to deal with the mental health benefits, it's helpful to create a personalized plan tailored to a specific problem. It's a great idea that you realize the help you can get from the task and self care.
It is a good tool, so please don't criticize myself, it is very helpful. A good reward is my phone when I end the day. You should try and reach this and see if it becomes a new tool for yourself.
Which one of your tasks have you able to check off so far? Which one was your first task?
Good! If you have time, writing down your goals with a pen and some paper can be good too!
Great! I really believe in you! You will be just fine and will feel better soon!
I recommend just more self-care and yoga to help breathe and be more mindful. This is going to be an opportunity for you to confront your fears and an ego that refuses to get the message.
Im okay thanks! Is there anything i can help you with?
What do you mean by you can't go out?
I know you don't have to look so good but I know you're dealing with this hard.
I understand it's tough to be alone when you're in the same house as most people. Does that make sense?
I work from home most days. When I do go out, I try to plan in the worst case scenario but I have some sort of break in schedule and plenty of time to do nothing.
With all these people around you can you communicate with anyone who you feel comfortable with?
That sounds like a great way to end a day.
Oh okay. Have you tried to go to a different bar?
It seems you are feeling like you are missing out on lots of experience for yourself. Do you think the shutdowns have changed the way you think about the world in general?
I find that I've started looking for ways to interact with others in my own community. I've had some large group events that I can actually participate in
I have been doing a lot of winter snow days in this case.
Have you tried even just texting, even if it's not really like a face-to-face thing?
I've been spending a lot of time outdoors too. I try to spend hours in nature as much as I can, even if its just walking in my backyard or what-have-you.
I hear you are finding comfort in just spending time with your dog because your kids are so stressed. That is a lot to handle.
it was my pleasure, enjoy your time out and the fresh air.
good to hear, happy to help! hope you're feeling better
I am doing well, thank you for asking. Is there anything specific you want to talk about?
You've asked for that? I am here to help.
Thank you, I am glad I could be of help! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
No. I have not been through that before. Are you want to talk about it or not?
You seem a hard working and determined person. I completely understand how you are feeling. Its amazing that you are determined to work so hard and do something about it.
That's great! This hard work will pay off with time. Keep working, it will help you to reduce anxiety.
Yes! My best advice to you is to take lots of care for your family. Give them all your time. They will love you and you can say that you will take care of yourself as well.
As a single parent it is hard to take care of people but still we have to give our best. I have big kids but they are young and they don't understand the situation. so i do my best with them.
You are welcome! And I hope that this will help you. You are not alone in this and things will get better. Keep good.
You as well. Thank you very much. Take care.
So you're feeling overwhelmed at work and are struggling with your workload. Why is this?
You are correct, having only one person is not enough to handle such a large workload. I am sorry to hear that.
You are right, not speaking to her, is not a good way to proceed, especially now. It is probably time to get a new job, where you are in demand and have all the support you need.
I see. Maybe you could push hard with your line manager. She’s close to the person in charge.
However, taking things one step at a time could be helpful. If you work out a script for what you could do while the main job, and then come home, take care of some things, you might feel better about your stress.
I agree. I haven't found anything in the past month, and I am starting to get worried.
That's very true. Sometimes there's no help here.
Have you considered looking to the HR department? Or maybe talking to someone from a different department?
That's a common problem. You do have to set your boundaries, but this is a sensitive issue for most people.
I completely understand. I've always had a problem with not spending enough time outside.
Yeah, the game must not be taking up so much time.
How long have you been working? And at what rate?
He says this to the same person? Do you believe he's lying to you?
You are telling me that this conversation has not changed anything? That you feel nothing different? Is there anything else bothering you in your work, I would suggest you tell them yourself first?
That's a great attitude to have. Starting to feel confident can help you to overcome your troubles. You don't have to stay trapped.
I'm doing well, thank you. How can I help you today?
People can be mean. You are going through a tough time and they are making fun of you?
Well, I'm glad you're trying to speak to people. Is there anyone close to you who could be a good friend to speak to? Or do you have any outside friends?
Are you a college student, or working for example? Do you have some college loans or money coming in?
Or look online for bargain stuff? It's a great way to get something, although it can be challenging to find something that fits.
Really I think that you should try and work on your self esteem.
Well it's probably not a good idea to make assumptions. But I think it's a wonderful idea to consider how you may be able to help them.
Yes that is a good idea. That would really help a lot. But if you don't like it that much it would be better to talk to them about it.
I just did a search online and there are a couple of sewing and altering tutorials that might help you out.
Yay! I hope the rest of your year is very nice and comfortable for you.
I hope you do too! Remember to take care of yourself and get well!
Goodbye! Have a great evening :))!
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you lost them due to a breakup?
I can understand how this would happen, especially after not talking for a month, especially with constant fighting.
So you are saying she was avoiding you while she was staying with you?
That can make the situation worse when you try to talk about the issue with others because others do not understand or agree with your perspective.
That is a valid concern. I can understand why that would be frustrating, especially if you valued honesty in the friendship.
I think it's very helpful to speak to your friend. What is it that you will do with your time after your friendship ends?
You might realize this will not be an easy conversation to have, but don't be too afraid and hopefully, it will help you.
You are an important person in her life and she felt she had nothing to fall back on. You are not stupid. I think most people would agree. Is this something you can apologize for?
However, I would suggest that you try to look for a therapist. It's a cruel way to have lost that friend, but I think it would make you realize how badly you hurt your friend. It's a lesson that you might take very well.
I'm glad. I hope that I was able to provide some encouragement to help you.
I have friends who have been betrayed and it was the hardest thing to hear at the time. But with time, it can get easier. Hope I have been able to help and that you are feeling a little more positive about it now.
Ok. Have a wonderful day. I wish you all the best!
Oh no! That can be really tough. I am so sorry you are going through this. What is your friend's name?
Have you tried talking to them about it? Or are you just dealing with it at home?
Of course, it can be really difficult to help someone with addiction. It's really not an easy situation to be in, and it can be very stressful.
The first thing you need to do is keep your distance from them when you know they're struggling. When you know they're going to be seeking your help or sympathy, you need to put more space between you and them.
It sounds like he might not be the best friend you want to have, if you will just call him that.
You are also the closest person to him, and he may not be able to take no for an answer. It's very selfish.
I understand that. I have been in similar situations before. I know how difficult that is.
Perhaps you could have an honest conversation with him about the situation and see if it isn't driving the behavior you're trying to change
That's understandable. And while the rest of your concerns will still be there, be prepared to hang in there and grow up.
And maybe you could suggest it to him, like... "You need to think of friends like me, who helped me", or some such thing.
Al-Anon has an online section, but definitely check out the offline ones.
I wish you all the best. You deserve it! :)
And I know that you are going to make good choices here for yourself!
Every success story starts with an area of struggling, and I have so much hope for you. You deserve help.
You are welcome, the best thing to do right now is make a plan on what steps to take going forward, which will help put you back on the right path, and make you feel better about it.
Do you feel you are getting better? Or worse?
Of course! You are welcome! I believe you.
Hello, How are you doing today? Any special problem?
I can relate to being depressed and struggling with thoughts of weight. So, it sounds like you are having some trouble with your boyfriend's influence?
Is it that your weight is affecting your self confidence.
It is no shame. Always positive that we can do our best in every aspect of life. Is it the external weight or is it the internal?
I see. I have seen that restricting food intake and being overly stressed about being fat can be traumatic.
I can understand that, research has shown that once you set a weight loss goal you are more likely to achieve it. It is better to have small long term goals rather than a big short term goal
Perhaps you have a day in your life already filled with work and time and this is eating up most of the time.
For a start I would suggest going for a brisk walk which can help improve the blood flow to the brain, I find that doing this helps me feel better and can motivate me to keep going.
Well i hope this was able to help. Enjoy the rest of your Christmas Day!
I recommend the two hiking groups i have listed on reddit as well. Well been a success and encouraged a lot of people to be more active.
Ok do your best just remember that your girl will run fast and run far she has alot of energy and that can help you.
Absolutely, we all are imperfect, its just how we work with it.
well its never too late to come back to some healthy ways to make you feel good again
you are very welcome. Enjoy the rest of your day
Hi there, how are you doing? What can I help you with today?
I see, sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
So, I hear you say you have long-standing depression. Can you tell me what your depression is about?
How long have you been dealing with depression, or were you diagnosed by a doctor?
So, you are concerned about this, not your children at all but you still want to show your parents that you're trying your best, that you care
By the way, you seem a very responsible parent.
Well being safe and protected is in all of our worlds right now.
perhaps try writing their names and your names on cards and send to them one by one after everyone is getting the information. So they can have a little time to themselves to adjust to this situation. If I understand correctly, you are working and doing your job without any issues. Are you able to talk to a friend/colleague in your job?
you have been very loyal with your father, you have to talk to your children and explain it again, maybe if they listen more, they will understand your reasons.
Sounds like you have a very hard life with a mental and physical health issue and self negative person
You're welcome :) keep your head up, I know you can get through this!
I am so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the issue you are experiencing?
That does sound like a tough situation, I'm sorry.
Ouch! I can see you have had this happen a lot recently?
I understand where you're coming from. It is always a fine line between sharing our opinions and being respected or not. It seems like you are feeling caught between two people. Do you see him in a more positive light?
Well, from what you are telling me, it sounds like this has been a long-standing issue, right? My experience is that when people are doing things that they shouldn't be, they often have a deep-seated insecurity.
I am so sorry to hear that. Is he close to you?
Yes. Unfortunately I have had to do that in the past with friends. There is nothing worse than asking a friend about something they believe.
What are the specific issues you think he is having?
Actually, there are a lot of resources you can use to find advice and other people to talk to.
Definitely a completely normal thing for someone to do in today's society and I can really understand why they feel that way because it can be really easy to get outside help but you never really know how or where you will turn to for that.
Of course! It was very nice talking to you too. Enjoy the rest of your day!
Anytime! Take care. :) Bye! :jezzel :jezzel
Hello! How's it going? What would you like to talk about today?
How are you? What would you like to talk about?
oh no, i am so sorry to hear that
I understand. What specific reasons are you worried about your financial situation?
Yes I know, it seems as though those things are not happening right now
As I said, I feel the same. It's really hurting.
Maybe some new avenues to go down. Have you tried to get yourself hired by your business?
Yes, they usually leave a message on your phone in case of an emergency
I'm kind of stuck in this same situation. Mturk has been the best job i've found at this time
The best thing to do in this situation is to go for it. When I searched for jobs on amazon, I clicked on the job description and found out I could apply online too
I'm hoping so too, as it's hard for me to imagine having to go back to our normal routine
I am happy to hear that. I believe in you. You can make it happen, know for sure. I can help you until you are successful. I have connections in the job market that I can tell you about.
Yes, working hard is truly an asset. I would get recommendations for you, make you a great friend to those who know you and know you well, and you can do everything you want to do. Things will be great in the future!
How about online surveys and temp work? Most places need help right now, who wouldn't want to get paid for their time?
Yes of course! In college I worked in restaurants, not much about my resume but much about my interests like me seen in my college résumés
You can apply online jobs or even reapply for old jobs if people don't like you at work. What ever you choose, you have to be professional.
But whatever, always make yourself resume interesting. Include some previous work in your resume and make your job experience look funny.
Have a great day :) I hope you'll be successful with your business!
Goodbye and hope all your presents are nice!
Hi there, how are you? What would you like to talk about?
Oh, I hear you. I have been there myself. This pandemic is really adding to that.
So the reason I'm hearing your answer is because your a senior! Is that right?
I actually started a blog (my daughter's name and I are both students) where I would write about our progress, and even get some support and encouragement from others. It was helpful!
Well, that's a bummer. But in general, shy people are actually the kindest and most friendly!
What are your hobbies? We've all tried to find a new way to engage with them because we are isolated or busy.
How many hours do you take per week? That way, maybe if you start small you can build up to more and get someone to reach out to you more.
I think you have made some great strides by exploring your options and finding ways to achieve your goals, but don't give up just yet, you can make this work.
Have you already spoken to your professor about it or have you learned of their policy on this matter? I think there might be a grace period, but I don't know, this is where I want to start with, what I can do for you?
You mentioned your final grades. I can understand why that's a concern, but, you know, you have tried your best! That's all that counts! "You are a work in progress."
Take more care of yourself, and practice some meditation, deep breathing exercises, to help you manage that self-doubt.
My pleasure. Take care, and good luck!
Oh no! You and your husband sound like you are on the same side. Does your husband know about your friend's infidelity?
What is going on with her cheating? What does your husband have to do to you in your opinion?
I believe you are feeling discouraged from discussing this with him because you are worried about him as well and know he is worried. Is that correct?
I understand the "girl code" in our cultures! It is only really effective if it means something that you both understand and agree on. Have you talked to your friend?
It seems like you understand the situation and can communicate with each other when faced with this kind of situation in the future. You sound like a real understanding friend.
Then honor your honesty, but also acknowledge that the conversation may not be easy. How do you feel after speaking with your friend?
I would go the other way around. Do you think your husband feels his friendship with your wife is valued?
My friend would be able to give you confidence. Don't worry, you will be able to know what you truly want.
I think i am ready for this to be over!
That's great! Is there any way that he could mention to her that you trust his values and he is going to go and get it if you need him
That sounds really frustrating! tell me what you are having trouble with.
That is really hard right now. I can understand the feeling. When I am stressed, I tend to think of stressful situations that I might hit rock bottom
Oh wow. That's tough! Have you thought of talking to your ex-husband to see if you can get more hours to make money? I have had to do that a few times before.
Exactly! What is one thing that you could do right now to find temporary relief from this stress?
There's an organization called the SBA that actually loans to businesses to help during this pandemic
I'm happy to be of help! It's also great to hear that you've started thinking about solutions! They might help you gain more control over your situation.
Yes, the last one was just announced, so you might be able to apply for it even though it's closed. For the second one, you have to be a US citizen. I hope this will help you!
I can feel the desperation right now too. Can you tell me when you started experiencing these feelings?
Thank you for talking. I absolutely support you. I know that there is a way to get through this. You are important. Meditation is one of my favorites, and a happy medium.
Please, if you need anything just swing by your mom's house! She's really nice and I bet she'll be able to assist with some things too. You're very welcome!
You too! You as well! Have a wonderful night!
Hello, I hope this chat is going well. How are you?
It was nice talking to you, how was the rest of your day?
That sounds like a hard move to make. I would suggest sending a donation to the rent due - for you to not have to be asked.
Tell me more. how did this happen? What did you say to her?
Hmm. ok, so you'd like to figure out why she didn't pay her rent?
Yay! its been a lovely conversation. You're very welcome. We can definitely talk more if you want.
For sure! And to leave you with a sense of warmth for another day!
Oh wow! That's great. Its good to surround yourself with happy people and have something to be proud of! I'm glad you love that tattoo!
no problem :) Anytime :) you have a great day as well!
What can I help you with today? Have you had any issues?
I’m doing well, how is that? I hear you want to talk, thats fine.
so your boyfriend left you and you ended up sleeping with another woman?
oh no that sounds awful. that must be a difficult thing to go through.
it sounds like you are really upset and frustrated.
i'm really sorry about the situation. how long were you with your boyfriend?
you seem stressed. how long have you been dealing with this?
you had an issue between you two before? if so what were those?
they will always break the heart, no matter how much you loved them.
i'm glad we had a chance to talk about it, it can be hard to come to terms with something like this.
If you feel that would resolve the situation or you want to discuss and help them to see why you couldn't do what they asked
that is good, you have the right to move on and it sounds like a good move for you
it sounds like it's making it difficult for you
find new hobbies that bring you joy. or see a therapist
being out will give you a chance to practice a sense of responsibility and a feel good feeling about yourself
it's a normal part of life. life is not fair but we all need to deal with these situations
your welcome and i hope you find joy in the things that make you happy, take your time finding the right person
Your right. are there good people you've already talked to?
yeah you too! have a good day. do you need to quit yet?
you have no idea. but you can control what they do
i think that you got a bit close to a truth
it's very nice to know you are here and listen
sorta with this person, it seemed there were more at issue than just how well you knew each other
You have been facing trouble at work? That is a tough place to be in! Can you tell me what kind of trouble you're having?
I am sorry to hear that! Is there a specific reason why you are facing trouble at work?
That is really bad. This is particularly hard on people whose jobs you were also considering getting into. Is there something in particular you like or are you generally unimpressed with any job at the moment?
What kinds of work do you do? Do you have any other source of income?
Would you like to discuss possible solutions you can take? I do not want you to give up!
Yes, it is very hard to apply for a job with such limited job openings and the competition for very few positions is high
What has happened in your company since the pandemic started?
That's great! I understand, I had completed college degree and had been considering returning to school. It was scary but it turned out great!
Well, if you try to find a new job at least you will not be depressed. Are you able to look for jobs now?
Do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work that might help?
Have you thought of looking for a job for a few months to give you time to heal?
Of course! I hope that you feel a little better now.
The time to "stay at home" is over, and I think people will start to return to the old routine soon.
I would pray that way too. You seem to be an adult, so I have no doubt that you can live safely and easily.
I understand. It sounds like we have a lot of pressure with lots of things happening in your life.
I am doing okay, how are you? Where would you like to talk about today?
Well, it is a shame when that happens because I know how hard it is to regret how we do things. Do you have some type of club or thing that you are in?
It's okay to look back on things and think we could have done better. What specifically could you have done better?
It sounds like you realize you made poor choices. You are in school and not even 21 yet, but those decisions were set in your mind long before you know it will be too late to change them.
I think sometimes it's hard to notice those grades unless you are one of those who isn't doing well.
Anytime. Have a great day. Take care.
Haha, that's awesome! You must feel proud of yourself now.
Hello. What would you like to talk about today?
How are you? I am sorry, how are you doing tonight?
Really lovely evening, thanks for asking. How may I help you tonight?
How are your finances doing, and how is your relationship with your family?
I am also working to get more younger at heart.
Could you please ask them again about the problem you are having?
I have had great success in knowing my emotions and can tell that it is normal for you to be sad.
Having some form of personal growth is very important for a person. I would say that while the relationship was difficult to share and getting rid of the pain and the betrayal is a major milestone, you did some really tough things for this person in the relationship. They did want to make the relationship work but that person was not the right one. This may be something to take pride in too and to celebrate, even if it is difficult to admit. It may make a person want to be happy for yourself
Of course and I appreciate sharing my thoughts with you. Have a great evening!
Hello! Yes Life can be hard right now.
So you are feeling really depressed and not motivated to do your daily activities.
Do you enjoy being with others? Have you had anyone to talk to?
It sounds like you are really an active person who just seems down, but I know that if you just take it easy for a little while you will start to feel better.
I would absolutely recommend that trip. Of course, April is a great time to go there, more flowers in bloom, and warmer, and beautiful trip. Also, you can do things like out in the woods for hiking and visit the beautiful lakes and the roadside markets.
You're welcome. Hopefully, I can help you in a more tangible way. I hope you find relief with those new meds. Thank you for speaking to me today. You're welcome!
No, I have never worked as a counselor, but I can try to help you on that. I want to share you with someone who has a background in counseling that may be able to help you.
I agree that it can be very difficult and burdensome to have to deal with the sadness when people that you care about but also want you to stay happy and be able to enjoy life. I hope that you have been able to realize your own importance in your life and that this has been able to help you in being happy.
Thank you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Thank you, have a great day! Happy New Year!
I can totally understand that. I get the same way at times, especially during the holidays.
It can be really tough being apart from family during the holidays. It sounds like a lot is pushing you down this year.
With this in mind, what are the things that are the most important to you? Do you have any hobbies, activities that make you happy or fulfilled?
Have you considered switching jobs or perhaps career path or perhaps finding a new job? I know it's very hard to think about when you have such a hard year going on
Sometimes when you reach out to someone, you have to put in a little effort, but when you get to know them a bit, you realize there is nothing to look forward to...
Video chat does have anxiety so I can totally understand that!
It sounds like you want to do things to get some fresh air and exercise as you can't go outside right now, especially with the cold and darkness in the winter.
It seems like we can all struggle to cope with anything right now
I also have a therapist. We talk about our feelings.
I hear you! That's a great idea.
So you have potential sunshine in the future, and just need to retrain yourself to go outside more!
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been seeing a therapist or some other form of support?
I have found that being a bit of a gamer and playing a lot of video games can definitely make it harder to do something else. I used to be very bad at mine too.
That's amazing! Game development has been a good source of income for you!
Was there anything else troubling you about life? Sorry if I have been causing you some distress, I am a little tired and confused with the way everyone is really struggling this year.
When I find myself coming up with excuses for coming back, I say to myself "What is the alternative? Is there something better I could be doing?"
It sounds like you've really established a strong relationship with gaming. Perhaps you do benefit from it?
I think you might need to break the beast, so to speak!
Do you think you might just be a perfectionist? Is it possible that you just get anxious and then create excuses for yourself?
I think that's a good start. Do you feel like that?
Is there someone else you could speak to about this? Perhaps a pastor?
Has the arrival of the new teacher had any effect on your studies?
For sure, League of Legends is a great game.
Of course! But that is a difficult and rather impossible person to change, even if you were to really speak to them
I hope you feel a bit better after the chat.
Please keep pressing quit and take the survey :) :)
Hi there, are you feeling anxious due to the pandemic?
It's actually really good that you're taking this step. Is there anything specific about the pandemic that is making you anxious?
Oh I completely get that! It sounds like the health risks associated with the pandemic are making it difficult to be around people.
I completely agree, and even though we had lock-downs, but then it turned out some areas had recorded infections early on. It seems to be that way with others.
Hello, welcome back. How are you feeling?
Wow! Goodness! I can't even imagine how that feels. I can feel your anxiety and frustration. But it sounds like that you have your life together, it's just a matter of interest. I am happy to encourage you to try new activities, both physically and mentally.
What kind of exercises have you been able to get to do recently? Even walking around is good. What was your favorite exercise?
So you are working and don't have any issues with routine or motivation but feel like you are wasting time and being disorganized and consume a lot of lost sleep and eating problems and are still engaged in procrastination. You feel disappointed and are feeling guilty about your life choices.
Sure. It's okay to not be happy about yourself. It's a normal reaction. Maybe you could get some more activities that you can do, you know, but don't know what they're going to be.
No problem, my pleasure. I can see why you feel that way, but it's also a choice that we have to make as we're working towards a bigger goal.
It's great that you have a strong faith and are drawing strength from it! That will help you navigate these difficult times.
Okay, yeah, it's about not wanting to feel guilty because we know that isn't all the time and at least we know what's going on. Plus, at least we can support each other.
I completely understand where you are coming from. I have been asking that question a lot in our conversations today. I have thought about it a lot too.
Take deep breaths, what you are referring to, I see. Being a wolf at table isn't right, but keeping your head on a swivel or growing apart, that's what we're talking about.
I really am! I'm glad to hear you're feeling more empowered to take a break from your black-and-white thinking. That's huge!
Well, as you said, I have no idea what you're referring to, so I'm all ears. Is there something else you are feeling?
That's right. Maybe we could plan on getting together at work or something to celebrate in the future!
Just out of curiosity: is everything okay with your job at home?
Ok, thanks for talking! Have a wonderful day!
Great, thanks! I'll take that off my resume! I really think you are on the right path.
You too! Keep in touch, hope everything turns up for you!
You as well. Stay strong and be safe out there
Can you tell me what your concerned about? Just tell me about it.
So you are worrying about the economic downturn and the pandemic, and specifically for you, you are worried about it in particular?
I understand this is a very worrying time for everyone, it is understandable.
That's a good way to think about it. There is no one in the world that you know of, right? Is that correct?
Have you tried talking to a professional? Sometimes there's hope, even if it's just that you have talked it out with a counselor.
I think that the thing I was trying to explain, in addition to learning some facts, is to notice any patterns in the things you read or watch.
Have you thought about visiting some public gardens or parks that still remain open and get a little of fresh air every day?
It's great to be able to talk about these things! It's a really hard time and I'm feeling the anxiety really. But we have to tell ourselves that we have it almost under control.
Yup! You're on your own now :)
Yeah. I've been there too. So, have you tried any out of the box methods to help manage your anxiety?
I'm all right with that. Trust is a trust that must be earned, not given.
Absolutely. Have a great day. Take care.
Hey! what is happening? when are you feeling sad?
I am glad I am here to help you. Do you want to tell me the reason of your emotional sadness?
Yes, I know it is a very difficult time. People are locked up at home and cannot see each other. But I will help you find the solution
We all have a tendency to feel what the other person is feeling, as you are the victim and are stuck in this situation so it is okay
Do you have any old pics of you and your boyfriend?
First of all, listen to your partner and communicate their reasons for the break up
I can try to help you, do you want me to discuss to your boyfriend?
Ok if you want to talk with your ex-boyfriend i suggest him to visit with you
Have you put your phone in airplane mode and lock, that will help
After breaking up, please practice self-care and good humor.
Please explain more about your depression and how you can overcome it
You are welcome. Do you have any holidays left? Or new year is coming soon.
Try to do it at least for a while.
Your welcome. Your best wishes to you. Stay healthy
that sounds really bad. could you tell me more?
How far along are you with your school work?
Ah, I see, I have had some similar worries recently and they have also been a driving force in my goal setting.
You're anxious about your grades and that is totally understandable. But being very high pressured by a parent like that doesn't help.
Is there someone at the school who could be of help with your situation?
I think it is good that you are not letting your anxiety get the better of you.
Oh, I feel like that also. I used to feel like that too when I was your age.
But hey at least she is offering. By the way, she needs to think more about you then.
Just because you have scholarships doesn't mean that she shouldn't take that pressure off of you.
Maybe there is some help out there from your favorite therapist or in your community? A lot of people have gone through this. You never know it all until the very end!
If you haven't already done this before I suggest trying and online filtering websites. You can search and apply for school loans online.
That is a very healthy question to ask, trust me it always helps! Do you think you can try to answer the question yourself?
Of course, and school is so very important. I think you should do as much as you can to help you manage your time effectively.
I do not have too many friends myself, but I am not anxious. It is just my own mindset. I think that you do make a good effort though, I am glad you are reaching out.
Yes it does help. They are a very important thing for you right now.
Are you able to change your situation, such as maybe getting your employer to give you more time off, or moving to a different city where you could go to college there?
I understand how you are feeling and I feel the same, as a matter of fact, I can relate to your anxiety.
I think that it is okay to feel self-conscious in this situation
Hello! How are you today? I am here to chat with you.
It sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed at work and this is leading to problems with your sleep
Is there anything that can help with this? A quiet place to give your presentation
If you had a bad experience with a bad presentation that gave you fear in the past, you can think of it in the back of your mind when you are going over your lines so you won't worry.
Unfortunately, I would say that even a professional is confident at some point, so I think it's been your attempt at to appear more confident than actual.
Well one thing I like to do is to look in my mirror, make eye contact with my image, and remember that everyone is staring at me.
I totally understand. How are you feeling for the conference? Have you heard the other people talking about the conference?
All my presenters have made it look easy. And they usually focus on the crowd (acknowledge their applause) after they are done! Try those a few days before the event.
From what I have observed, most people at first would be prepared to get nervous or intimidate about stage or public.
Well, no it doesn't. If it does, you might think of it as a black mark.
No problem. It was my pleasure to help you.
I am well. Would you like to talk about what is bothering you?
I can understand how that is. That's a really tough feeling. Do you have someone you can talk to?
That is indeed a scary situation! Would you like to share more about it?
Have you heard of the phrase "between the cracks" at the back of your mind?
Yes definitely! Let's start with doing things to get positive vibes. You can try by passing hobbies that you used to enjoy to bring back a change of mood. Take care of yourself during this pandemic time, which includes a healthy diet, staying away from contact with those who are unhealthy, and get plenty of sleep
Good! So, having the vaccine is a good thing to keep in mind.
There are still movies, books and TV shows you can get excited about. You can pick up some hobbies and personal growth activities as well.
Things are getting much better. We all miss our loved ones but social distancing is helping to keep everyone safe. Stay calm and think positively.
Keep positive, and think about all of the good things that year has to offer.
I guess you could take this opportunity to set up your career even more.
I understand, it is wonderful that you have a sense of purpose.
You're most welcome. Don't be afraid to call in for some extra shifts
Yeah, I can imagine that. I would definitely not feel alone or alone with that. This is a relatively new aspect of the pandemic for me.
Ah I understand - it is getting harder for some of us to start each day but you have all the power in your life to handle it.
Alcohol might make you feel better in the short term but is it really worth it?
I hope you can make it home safely! Is there anyone else that you can go with?
Did you do a lot of it? Was it a lot?
Yes, absolutely not! You don't want to have poor health from drinking at all
Will you be able to get back to work tomorrow? I hope the weather stays nice and good
But that sounds a lot less bad than actually doing it, doesn't it?
Maybe, although too much of it is not a good thing.
For sure. Google google google and Google :) AND smoking *sizzles*.
Need any more ideas or are you doing something else for now?
And another thing! Do you think we are "Human"?
That's great! And you will definitely get a job soon because engineering is a fantastic field.
It's the worst thing not being able to work.
Oh totally. I would anyway. Just ask!
Have a good night and best wishes to you :)
Ah i am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
Ah! So you are anxious about the deadline? Why are you feeling this way?
I had the same experience once when I had to finish a project last minute. I was really stress out, but I worked hard. I remember being successful once after that.
How do you feel about your work being pitted against other students?
You could do that, take the time each day and make it the focus of your work.
Based on the rough estimate for 30 revisions, you can make the revision work load 20 hour.
Good luck to you! I hope you have a good end
Take a short break. Rest your body and brain by taking a walk. That's good way to relax.
Good! I am sure, you will see a change in this project
You're welcome! It was my pleasure. Have a good day.
Hello, how are you? I see that you want to talk.
Oh no, why do you feel that way?
that must be hard to get married. When can you consider that?
i can understand your worry and this is already making you feel anxious.
hats, have you asked your fiancée if there is a way to stay together through a pandemic, although i do not know if it is possible
are you in a remote area or close to your fiancée?
my guess is he not to interested. You said it feels good to say it all out loud which i am happy to hear
i think you could just move to the US first and apply for a business visa to stay there, that way you can move to Indonesia, which also closed due to covid.
you are most welcome, i hope you feel so much better now
make sure to wear your mask when talking to your fiancée.
you are welcome. i wish you the best.
good day, bye! *online break* I will be back!
I'm good too, how about you? Have you had any issues lately?
Well I understand that being a predator would not be something you'd want. If you can keep your heart is in, I think if you ignore him both will eventually realize they're meant to be single and go on but he'll probably go ahead and see you when you're not interested so just keep him at bay and don't let him make your head up you deserve so much better than him but at the same time, you don't want to be hurt so no matter what it's a trade
I know it's hard to feel that way when you've been with someone for a while.
So you don't want to get into anything dramatic? I understand. What make you want to be with people in relationships?
I think it sounds like you are very mature and know what you want. Have you tried to talk to your friends and family about your needs?
I understand what you are saying. It sounds like you think that the relationships are more about the physical stuff than the real connection
I understand what you are saying and don't want to settle for anything less. I understand that you want something more, and I think it's completely normal.
Would you think it's possible for this relationship to grow and actually work in the long run, considering you don't feel comfortable enough to go public with your relationship?
I think that's part of the risk of this type of relationship. Are you in it for all the right reasons?
Your input and wisdom with no input will give you more insight.
That sounds like a great start. Do you think the man is a person you are interested in dating?
You're welcome! Goodnight! Have a wonderful night!
Hi, I'm doing alright. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about?
Oh i'm sorry you are having a hard time.
it sounds like it's really hard and difficult to take during covid and also after
So you know you can get a raise in the future if needed. What's stopping you from looking for a new job?
how long have you been in this job? maybe I can learn some tips that help you find another job?
I understand it must be uncomfortable knowing that you may lose a job even with your experience
Wow that is nice. Thank you for sharing that with me. Just from speaking with you, I can tell you're doing great.
This is a tough time for everyone, maybe you can be one of the best you can be and use your experience to benefit others.
Honestly I just wanted to be free from the pointlessness of a life that is my own make up. I think a good designer could be a possibility and the fact is that they are in high demand!
of course you have to have a good understanding of security or copyright laws for those gigs
I understand that, i went from a almost 20 year tenure in retail to freelancing through upline companies
no problem and you are very welcome i wish you the best of luck you will do fine and just keep in mind try not to get in over your head lol
May the best of you beach comin' next to you and may you find success
Hey, how can I help you? Want to talk?
I am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about what happened?
From what you've shared with me, I can understand how frustrating that is. I myself have been in this position.
Is this a job that you have had for a long time, or is it one that you just found out about recently?
You seem like a hard working and dedicated person. I am sure your manager would appreciate your diligence in considering a re-employment opportunity for you.
It's absolutely positive of you for wanting to stay and potentially find a new job with a similar impact. It's hard, but it's your company.
I can understand your concerns about relocating, but sometimes relocating is a necessary step in your career for better job opportunities.
Do you think you might be prepared to negotiate?
That's great! You're welcome! I hope you have a great day!
Sounds like a great plan! Best of luck with everything. Have a great day and take care!
So I'm sorry to hear that. When did this happen?
I am sorry to hear that. Did you tell your girlfriend you were planning on ending the relationship and she disagreed?
I am a bit sad myself that it happened, but I think it is okay to feel that way.
So from your account, when she found out, she chose to end things with you?
Are you sure you do not want to try and talk things through? I would certainly be willing to listen.
But if you two are not really best mates or something you don't want to get back together.
It might be better to tell her directly but not specifically accusing her of anything, might she be willing to have a talk with you
Yes, apologize, and try to make it as quick as possible so she doesn't feel like you've got nothing to talk about
Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?
How would you say that your job isn't rewarding?
Oh that's a dead end. I was like that before I made my career change.
But sometimes I just close the door and go for a walk in nature to clear my head.
I also feel such a way at times. I do not feel rewarded for the work I do.
Yeah, and it's true. I really think that if you put in a little effort, you could find a better job that is actually going to pay more. Have you tried applying for better positions?
That must be frustrating. Are there any ways you could negotiate a better job with your boss? Perhaps as a replacement for other expiring contracts?
I understand that you do feel sad that your boss has found another job. I don't blame you for feeling that way. However, do you feel that your feelings are unjust and your life is just one blow at a time?
Yes. If you feel that your job is not as important as your personal well-being then it may be best to continue working at your current job and taking steps to increase your personal well-being.
What about other skills you could be learning to contribute more to the company?
Is there anything about your previous job that you like to give your new boss a chance to do as well? Maybe some ideas you have about something that you think he will like.
Well I'm sure you can't let the change in people get to you if you don't find the same pleasure in other things.
Anyway you have spoken to your boss and got some ideas for you, and you have talked to someone about it, that's definitely something you can see as a step forward!
I have found that a single small step to reduce work might allow us to take a bit more at a time. It's hard to get started with the type of change and assume it will all happen overnight!
is there anything else you need from me? Have you thought of any other strategies you could try?
You too, I hope things get better for you!
